The retrieved data primarily covers failure modes of related or adjacent components like Cylinder liner assembly or Piston cooling jet, and mainly focuses on sealing, oil leakage, contact issues, and oil quantity delivered at the liner, but not directly on the crankcase directing oil to the liner assembly. Thus, this represents a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT scenario requiring multi-perspective brainstorming to generate comprehensive failure modes, effects, and causes specifically for the crankcase function of directing oil to the cylinder liner assembly, while leveraging retrieved data patterns related to oil delivery, sealing, and mechanical interface issues for inspiration and to ensure consistency with the general failure landscape in similar subsystems of gas engines."
Direct oil to lubrication system,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data contains multiple detailed failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes explicitly linked to the Crankcase component in the Engine Block subsystem of the Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact function 'Direct oil to lubrication system' or closely related sealing/lubrication functions. These data include specific failure modes such as 'Too little oil flow', 'Oil leakage', 'Oil leakage over time', 'Cleanliness not given', and others, with well-defined technical failure causes and effects. Therefore, only the retrieved data context is used, and no new failure modes, causes, or effects are generated outside that scope."
Direct Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element is 'Crankcase' with the specific function 'Direct Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system' in a 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Retrieved data contains failure modes and causes primarily related to the 'CCV (blow-by) system' component, which is functionally related but not exactly the same system element (Crankcase vs CCV). Also, no direct failure mode for the exact function of 'Direct Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV' from the crankcase was found. Some relevant failure modes and causes exist for 'Oil leakage' and 'Sealing against leakages oil' in the crankcase component, but failure modes related explicitly to the specific function of directing oil-gas mixture to the CCV system are absent. This points to a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT scenario where extrapolation and generation based on technical knowledge and related data is required. The crankcase function to direct the oil-gas mixture to the CCV system involves fluid flow path integrity, sealing interfaces, pressure differentials, and possible contamination or blockage issues. Hence, brain-storming includes possible loss of function (no or insufficient oil-gas mixture flow), functional limitation (flow restriction), functional interruption (blockage), functional fluctuation (intermittent flow), overfunction (excessive flow), unintended function (backflow or leak), and sticking at a pressure or flow value.IRL environmental, design, maintenance, and assembly factors are considered for failure causes."
Provide contact interface to cylinder head assembly,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function to provide contact interface to cylinder head assembly) matches exactly with retrieved data contexts.

The retrieved data contains multiple directly relevant failure modes (e.g., Lack of sealing, System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages in Crankcase, Leakage of blow-by gas) and their associated effects and causes that are contextually accurate for this system element and function. No generation of new failure modes, causes, or effects outside this exact context is necessary, ensuring full compliance with the EXACT_MATCH directive."
Provide contact interface and structural support to V-room isolation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact match failure mode data was found for the 'Crankcase' component with the function 'Provide contact interface and structural support to V-room isolation' in the Gas Engine Type 4 system's Engine Block subsystem. Retrieved data predominantly references failure modes for the V-room insulation and related components affecting airflow or sealing but not specifically for the crankcase supporting the V-room isolation function. Although some failure causes and effects relating to crankcase design exist (e.g., bolted joint design, joint leakage, vibration), these relate mainly to sealing or mounting issues rather than the structural support and contact interface function. Therefore, the situation represents a different context within the same product category and subsystem but a different function and system element focus. Hence, a creative yet technically informed brainstorming approach is required to generate comprehensive failure modes, effects, and causes for the Crankcase's function to provide contact interface and structural support for V-room isolation. The generation will consider structural mechanics, sealing, joint integrity, and interface phenomena critical for crankcase function under gas engine operational stresses."
Seal against coolant leakages,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data precisely corresponds to the target context with matching product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and function (Seal against coolant leakages).

Therefore, no new failure modes, effects, or causes are generated outside the retrieved data. The retrieved context provides comprehensive FMEA information for failure modes such as 'Oil leakage', 'Oil leakage over time', and 'Degradation of sealing over time' specifically for the Crankcase sealing function. Corresponding failure effects and causes are thoroughly described with appropriate technical terms and preventive/detective measures, consistent with FMEA standards."
Transmit energy between crankcase and CCV (blow-by) system,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no exact match for the specific system element 'Crankcase' with the function 'Transmit energy between crankcase and CCV (blow-by) system' within the Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem in the retrieved data. The retrieved data mainly focuses on the CCV (blow-by) system functions related to flow and pressure management, sealing, leakage, and vibration effects but not specifically on the crankcase transmitting energy to the CCV system. Therefore, multi-perspective brainstorming has been applied to generate technical failure modes, effects, and causes based on general engineering principles for crankcase to CCV energy transmission, while adapting insights regarding sealing, vibrations, pressure interactions, and design causes related to the crankcase and blow-by system interface."
Allow venting locations for coolant circuit,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase) and function (Allow venting locations for coolant circuit) from retrieved data.

The retrieved data provides failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes directly related to the Crankcase component’s sealing function within this system context, so only retrieved data is used without additions."
Provide contact and fit to PCJ (Power Cylinder Joint),"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact match found for the failure mode 'Provide contact and fit to PCJ' function of the 'Crankcase' in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. Although the system element (crankcase) and product context are identical, the exact function 'Provide contact and fit to PCJ' has no directly retrieved failure modes, effects, or causes. The retrieved data contains related failure modes for crankcase and PCJ interactions (e.g., sealing failure, misalignment, contact issues) but none exactly address the fit/contact function of crankcase to PCJ. Therefore, based on the decision matrix, this is a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT scenario that requires expert brainstorming to generate relevant technical failure modes, effects, and causes based on domain knowledge and similarity to known failure mechanisms of crankcase and PCJ interface functions in gas engine systems. The generated failure outputs leverage known related failure modes (misalignment, lack of sealing, contact failure) adapted technically to the precise function 'Provide contact and fit to PCJ'."

The available data mostly concerns the 'Crankcase' and 'CCV (blow-by) system' components focusing on sealing, vibration, serviceability, and leakage-related functions. The rear end cover's function (providing maintenance space) is fundamentally a mechanical accessibility and structural interface function rather than fluid sealing or sensor installation related functions.
