Retrieved failure data relates mostly to other elements such as Crankcase, V-room insulation, and CCV system with sealing or leakage functions but not specifically to the front end housing sealing. Although the system category and subsystem are matching, the system element and function are sufficiently distinct, requiring multi-perspective brainstorming combined with adaptation of relevant retrieved failure modes and causes where applicable to generate technically accurate failure modes, effects, and causes for the front end housing sealing function."

Direct oil to the crankcase,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' has the specific function to 'Direct oil to the crankcase'. No exact or closely matching failure mode data exists for this element-function combination in the retrieved database. Relevant retrieved failure data relate mostly to 'Crankcase' and 'V-room insulation' components directing or sealing oil, which are neighboring or related engine block components but not the exact element targeted. Hence, this represents a fundamentally different functional element with unique structural and flow path characteristics. Therefore, a multi-perspective brainstorming effort using internal knowledge and adapted retrieved patterns is applied to generate technically accurate and context-appropriate failure modes, causes, and effects applicable for the 'Front end housing' oil directing function."
Receive oil from turbocharger oil circuit,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element is 'Front end housing (damper housing)' with the function 'Receive oil from turbocharger oil circuit' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a 'Gas Engine Type 4' product. The retrieved data contains no exact matches for this specific system element and function combination in the engine front-end housing context; however, there is a directly applicable failure mode related to oil leakage in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component. This allows exact transfer of relevant failure data for this element/function. Other retrieved failure modes pertain mainly to the crankcase and related oil circuit parts, not this component specifically, so they are not directly applicable but inform broader understanding. Given the absence of exact-match broader failure modes related to oil flow reception from turbocharger and focus on sealing/oil leakage, the decision is DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with partial exact-match transfer for leakage failure, supplemented by standard multi-perspective brainstorming on possible failure modes related to this function (oil reception). This includes potential oil flow interruptions and functional fluctuations relevant to a housing receiving oil, and related failure causes like assembly, sealing, and design errors, consistent with known engine front-end housing failure patterns. Thus, failure modes, effects and causes are generated based on the retrieved failure mode 'Oil leakage' of the 'Front end housing (damper housing)', as well as logical extension of failure modes possible for oil receiving and conducting function including oil delivery interruption and functional fluctuation due to contamination or mechanical damage, aligned with FMEA standards and technical accuracy."

Direct coolant to the crankcase,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact context or retrieved failure modes, effects, or causes are found specifically for the Front end housing (damper housing) with the function 'Direct coolant to the crankcase' in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4. Existing data covers coolant-related failures primarily within the crankcase or related coolant flow routes but not specifically the front end housing directing coolant. The front end housing’s coolant directing function implies coolant flow path/channeling, sealing interfaces, and structural support for coolant routing. This context differs enough from retrieved data focused on crankcase coolant flow or sealing to justify a differentiated failure mode analysis. Therefore, a multi-perspective brainstorming approach is applied, considering design, development, testing, and after-sales perspectives to formulate plausible technical failure modes, their related effects, and causes relevant to coolant directing function of front end housing. Existing knowledge about coolant flow failures, leakage, structural integrity, and sealing within engine blocks informs this generation."
