Given function similarity as close with same element and failure cause/mode, preventive and detective measures for 'Adverse piston motion over time' with cause 'Piston offset' from the exact product and system can be transferred and applied to the target context, as these measures technically address the root cause (piston offset) affecting piston motion that impacts absorption of piston loads. No contradictory measures or context conflicts exist."

The measures for 'V-room insulation' are transferable and applicable to 'Crankcase' given both affect the air/gas flow path in the engine block and share identical failure cause and mode."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function is directing air/gas/mixture to cylinder head assembly, failure mode is Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder, and failure cause is Casting tolerances (Crankcase). Retrieved context data has multiple exact preventive and detective measures for similar failure modes and causes on the closely related system element V-room insulation with identical failure cause and mode and same product and subsystem. The failure cause (casting tolerances) is the same, and the system element (crankcase) is exactly the same as failure cause attribution, but preventive measures are documented for the V-room insulation element handling the same function (air/gas mixture flow). Therefore, the measures from V-room insulation for this failure cause are applicable and transferable to Crankcase for this failure mode in Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 4, in the Engine Block subsystem, with the Crankcase element functionally directing/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly. The failure mode is 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' and failure cause is 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)', which matches failure cause and failure mode of 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' and closely related variants ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' and 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder') in the V-room insulation system element. Exact system element is different ('Crankcase' vs. 'V-room insulation'), but function and failure cause/mode are the same and product and subsystem identical, so measures are transferable and applicable given the similar function related to directing/leading air/gas/mixture to cylinders. No exact data exists for Crankcase with the given failure mode/cause, but the V-room insulation data for this failure mode and cause can be applied by analogy. The preventive and detective measures from V-room insulation context thus apply to Crankcase directing air/gas/mixture function for transient engine operation failure cause with insufficient air/gas/mixture failure mode."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, with function to direct/lead air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head assembly, failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Combustion system'. Retrieved data provides measures mainly for 'V-room insulation' element with the exact same failure mode and cause in the same product and subsystem, but different system element. The function and failure context are highly similar because both relate to directing air/gas mixture to cylinders and combustion system cause. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the 'V-room insulation' component are applicable and transferable to the Crankcase component context because the failure cause and mode context is effectively the same in the gas flow path to cylinder head. No direct data for crankcase with this exact failure cause/mode was found, so using highly similar context measures is valid."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Crankcase design'. Retrieved context data primarily covers this failure cause paired with the 'V-room insulation' system element, same subsystem and product, same failure mode and cause. V-room insulation functionally allows air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head, very close in flow path to crankcase function (directs/leads air/gas/mixture to cylinder head). Measures for crankcase design causing insufficient air/gas mixture in V-room insulation thus highly applicable to the Crankcase here. No exact matches for Crankcase element with this failure mode/cause were found, but the similarity is close enough (same product, subsystem, failure mode, failure cause) to transfer the provided measures. Detective measures are available only for V-room insulation context with same failure mode and cause, and they sensibly apply also to Crankcase detection of this failure. Therefore, all preventive and detective measures from the V-room insulation data for this combination will be transferred and applied."
V-room design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function directing/leads air/gas/mixture to cylinder head assembly, failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', and failure cause 'V-room design'. The retrieved data has multiple exact matches on Product, Subsystem, Failure Cause, Failure Mode with system element named 'V-room insulation' performing very similar function (allows/directs air/gas/mixture to cylinder head). The difference is that the system element is named 'V-room insulation' rather than 'Crankcase' but both are in the same subsystem and related to the gas flow path, effectively constituting a SIMILAR_CONTEXT match by system element identity variation within the same subsystem and product. Measures are still applicable to the failure cause 'V-room design' related to flow disturbance in the crankcase/insulation area that directs the mixture to cylinder head."
Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context matches the Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', Failure Mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', and Failure Cause 'Material selection', but the System Element 'Crankcase' differs from the retrieved data from 'V-room insulation' that has the same function and failure mode and cause in the same product and subsystem. Measures from 'V-room insulation' are transferable and applicable to 'Crankcase' as both guide Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly in the same product category and subsystem context."
Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The exact target context is for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', Function 'Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly', Failure Mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', Failure Cause 'Design for maintenance'. Retrieved data contains exact matches at Product and Subsystem level for similar failure mode and cause but for System Element 'V-room insulation' (also directing air/gas mixture to cylinder head). Given the same product category, subsystem, very similar system element function and identical failure mode and cause, preventive and detective measures for 'Design for maintenance' under this failure mode are transferable and applicable to Crankcase as well. Measures that target design for maintenance for flow disturbance of gas to cylinder in the engine block of Gas Engine Type 4 are relevant for crankcase context, as flows and maintenance design impact are comparable. Hence, preventive and detective measures from V-room insulation context are used. No direct measures are found for crankcase specifically but derived ones are applicable and consistent with FMEA standards."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context matches the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (directing air/gas mixture to cylinder head), failure mode (flow disturbance of gas to cylinder), and failure cause (casting tolerances on crankcase) almost exactly except that the retrieved data refers primarily to related component 'V-room insulation' performing similar function of allowing flow of air/gas mixture toward cylinder head with failure cause also 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'. The system elements (Crankcase vs V-room insulation) differ but belong to the same subsystem and share the same failure cause impacting flow disturbance. Thus, preventive and detective measures applicable to this failure cause in the V-room insulation context can be transferred and are meaningful for the crankcase in the flow disturbance context. Measures related exclusively to other failure modes or failure causes, or unrelated system elements, are excluded. Measures are consistent with FMEA standards and only address failure cause or failure cause–failure mode combinations as per requirements."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target context is the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), same subsystem (Engine Block), same failure mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder'), same failure cause ('Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)') but different system element (target is 'Crankcase' vs retrieved data primarily for 'V-room insulation'). The system elements are functionally related within the same subsystem and share the same failure mode and cause. Measures related to 'V-room insulation' and 'Crankcase design' in the retrieved data are transferable and applicable for the 'Crankcase' element guiding the air/gas to the cylinder head assembly."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Combustion system' causing 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' (part of Engine Block subsystem in Gas Engine Type 4) matches the same failure mode and failure cause combination retrieved for 'V-room insulation' within the same product and subsystem but different system element. The measures listed for 'V-room insulation' in this context are technically applicable as they target the combustion system cause related to flow disturbance to cylinder in the engine block gas flow path. No direct data for 'Crankcase' system element for this failure cause in the exact context was found. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are transferred from the matching similar context data of 'V-room insulation' system element within the same product category and subsystem."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Crankcase design' linked to failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' on system element 'Crankcase' in subsystem 'Engine Block' of product 'Gas Engine Type 4' has no exact match in the retrieved context (only similar context exists on 'V-room insulation' system element for the same failure mode and cause). Measures related to 'Crankcase design' and 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' from 'V-room insulation' can be transferred because the system element function is equivalent in the same subsystem and product, within the Gas Engine Type 4 product category. Additionally, preventive and detective measures for 'Crankcase design' for the same failure mode in related components confirm applicability. Therefore, measures related to 'Crankcase design' causing 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' are adapted here without introducing new measures beyond the retrieved data. Detective measures from 'V-room insulation' are applicable as they are focused on detection of flow disturbance caused by crankcase design defects."
Intake manifold and V-room design,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved context data for 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Crankcase' element, function related to directing the air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head, failure mode 'Inconsistent gas density across cylinders', and failure cause 'Intake manifold and V-room design'. Measures from identical contexts have been used without transfer or omission."
Cylinder head interface design,"EXACT_MATCH based on the retrieved data matching exactly the Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (providing gas mixture route to cylinder head), Failure Mode (Inconsistent gas density across cylinders), and Failure Cause (Cylinder head interface design). The retrieved measures directly address this failure cause in the same system context."

Material plasticity,"EXACT_MATCH, because the target system context matches exactly with retrieved context data for Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Crankcase, Function: Contact to CCV (blow-by) system, Failure Mode: Lack of sealing, Failure Cause: Material plasticity, Failure Effect: Oil in environment. Preventive and detective measures from this exact context are applied."
Liquid sealing degradation,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Contact to CCV (blow-by) system), Failure Mode (Lack of sealing), and Failure Cause (Liquid sealing degradation). Measures are taken directly from the retrieved context without extrapolation."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, Contact to CCV (blow-by) system, Leakage of blow-by gas, Assembly process / Design for assembly) partially overlaps with retrieved context data focused on the CCV (blow-by) system element with the same product, subsystem, failure mode and failure cause. Although the system element is 'Crankcase' in the target and 'CCV (blow-by) system' in the retrieved data, these components are directly functionally connected (crankcase contacts CCV system for blow-by gas path). The failure cause and failure mode match exactly for leakage of blow-by gas due to assembly process/design for assembly. According to the similarity definitions, this is an EXACT_MATCH or very close context transferable since the failure cause, product, subsystem, and failure mode match. Thus, only preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context data for assembly process/design for assembly related leakage of blow-by gas are applicable. Preventive measures correspond to controlling assembly quality and design for assembly aspects; detective measures pertain to assembly trial and functional tests of the CCV system to detect leakage. Preventive measures from the crankcase design and sealing specifications for blow-by leakage are also relevant as the crankcase interfaces with the CCV system. Therefore, the measures below are properly aligned with the target context based on retrieved data."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function related to contact to CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode leakage of blow-by gas, failure cause crankcase design. Exact match data is not available specifically for Crankcase with the stated function and failure mode. However, multiple retrieved entries exist for very similar system element (CCV or Crankcase), same product, same subsystem, with the same failure cause and similar failure modes relating to leakage of blow-by gas or leakage outside, associated with crankcase design. Preventive and detective measures related to crankcase design from these similar contexts are valid and applicable. The measures address failure cause of crankcase design and the failure mode leakage of blow-by gas or leakage crankcase (outside), which is technically consistent for the target context. Therefore, transfer of preventive and detective measures from similar contexts is appropriate and requested by the user."
CCV (blow-by) system design,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Crankcase, Function: Contact to CCV (blow-by) system, Failure Mode: Leakage of blow-by gas, Failure Cause: CCV (blow-by) system design) directly corresponds to retrieved data entries specifically addressing the failure cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design' causing 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in the same product, subsystem, and very closely related system element (CCV system interacting with crankcase). Although the system element in retrieved data is mostly 'CCV (blow-by) system', the function and failure cause match exactly since the crankcase interfaces to the CCV system causing leakage due to CCV design. Preventive and detective measures from these exact matches are directly applicable without modification."
Piping design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context refers to the 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem for the function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system' with failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' caused by 'Piping design'. The retrieved data predominantly covers the same product ('Gas Engine Type 4') and subsystem ('Engine Block'), and failure cause ('Piping design') but mainly addresses the 'CCV (blow-by) system' as the system element. Given that 'Crankcase' is the interface component contacting the 'CCV (blow-by) system' piping and functionally connected, the similarity is sufficient to transfer preventive and detective measures related to 'Piping design' from the CCV system context. Preventive measures specifically targeting failure cause 'Piping design' are applicable as per FMEA standards since the root cause is identical. Detective measures for the failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' caused by 'Piping design' in the CCV system also apply to detection of leakage from the crankcase piping interface, supporting early failure identification. Hence, measures retrieved are transferred preserving technical correctness and applicability."
Gasket & O-Ring design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function Contact to CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode Leakage of blow-by gas, failure cause Gasket & O-Ring design, while retrieved context data is mainly from the CCV (blow-by) system element with matching failure cause and failure mode, and given the close functional relation (Crankcase interfaces with CCV system via blow-by gas sealing), measures for CCV system leakage by Gasket & O-Ring design are applicable and transferable to the Crankcase context."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase with function Contact to CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode Leakage of blow-by gas over time, failure cause Assembly process / Design for assembly. Retrieved context data shows many exact matches for the failure cause Assembly process / Design for assembly but in the CCV (blow-by) system element, which is a related system element within the same subsystem and product. Measures for Assembly process / Design for assembly failure cause related to leakage of blow-by gas over time in CCV (blow-by) system are applicable and technically sensible to be transferred to the Crankcase for its contact to the CCV system. Hence, preventive and detective measures from the matching failure cause in CCV (blow-by) system have been applied accordingly."
O-Ring aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, Function: Contact to CCV system, Failure mode: Leakage of blow-by gas over time, Failure cause: O-Ring aging) does not exactly match any retrieved context exactly because the retrieved data mostly relate to the CCV (blow-by) system element rather than the Crankcase element itself. However, the failure cause 'O-Ring aging' combined with similar failure modes 'Degradation of sealing over time', 'Blow-by leakage', 'Oil leakage', and 'Gas mixture leakage' in components within the Engine Block subsystem for the Gas Engine Type 4 product share sufficiently similar contexts and engineering applicability. Hence, applicable preventive and detective measures for 'O-Ring aging' from these contexts can be transferred and applied to the Crankcase failure caused by O-Ring aging for blow-by gas leakage. The measures remain technically relevant to the O-Ring aging cause for sealing and leakage failures across the subsystem. No measures beyond retrieved context data are added."
Crankcase design,"EXACT_MATCH because the target context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, function: contact to CCV blow-by system, failure mode: leakage of blow-by gas over time, failure cause: crankcase design) exactly matches retrieved data entries of the same product, subsystem, system element (including mapping crankcase as the interface to CCV system), failure mode, and failure cause. The retrieved data provides precise preventive and detective measures for the crankcase design causing leakage of blow-by gas over time failure mode."
CCV (blow-by) system design,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data (Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: CCV (blow-by) system, Failure Mode: Leakage of blow-by gas over time, Failure Cause: CCV (blow-by) system design). Measures are therefore directly taken from this exact context retrieved."
Piping design,"EXACT_MATCH because the target context exactly matches entries for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'CCV (blow-by) system', Function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system' or functional equivalent ('Directs blow-by gas from crankcase to gas mixer'), Failure Mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time', and Failure Cause 'Piping design'. Retrieved context provides direct preventive and detective measures for the exact failure cause."
Gasket & O-Ring design,"EXACT_MATCH: The target context is for a Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function Contact to CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode Leakage of blow-by gas over time, failure cause Gasket & O-Ring design. Retrieved data includes exact matches with the same product, subsystem, and very closely related system element (CCV (blow-by) system) covering the same failure mode and cause. Preventive and detective measures are explicitly provided for this exact combination, thus only these measures from the exact match are used without transfer or extrapolation."

Therefore, only context-exact preventive and detective measures directly related to 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' causing 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' are used."

The retrieved data provides detailed preventive and detective measures for the failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' but primarily in the context of the CCV (blow-by) system element carrying the same failure mode within the same product and subsystem. Given the close functional and subsystem relevance and the system element identity (Crankcase is contact/interface to CCV system), the measures for CCV (blow-by) system are applicable with no conflicts and suitable terminology transfers.

The retrieved context provides direct preventive and detective measures for this exact combination."
Piping design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context involves the Crankcase element contacting the CCV (blow-by) system for the failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' caused by 'Piping design'. The retrieved data mostly relates to the CCV (blow-by) system element and its function of distributing blow-by gas to the filter system with exactly the same failure mode and cause. The system element differs (Crankcase vs CCV system) but they are closely connected in function within the same subsystem and product. Therefore, preventive and detective measures for the same failure cause in the closely related CCV system are applicable and technically relevant for the Crankcase contact function to CCV system. Measures referring to 'Piping design' causing blocking of gas flow path to filter are transferable and compliant with FMEA standards."

Design for vibration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Poor serviceability', and failure cause 'Design for vibration'. No retrieved data exactly matches the system element 'Crankcase' for the exact failure mode and cause. However, multiple retrieved data entries relate to the CCV (blow-by) system contacting or related to the crankcase, with the same failure cause ('Design for vibration') and failure mode ('Poor serviceability') in the same product and subsystem context. Thus, this is a similar context as the system elements (Crankcase vs. CCV (blow-by) system) differ but are functionally linked, and failure mode and cause align. Preventive and detective measures from the CCV (blow-by) system failure cause 'Design for vibration' and failure mode 'Poor serviceability' are applicable and sensible for the crankcase in contact with CCV system regarding vibration influence on serviceability. The measures do not contradict target context and follow FMEA guidelines."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system has System Element 'Crankcase' with Function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system' and Failure Cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' causing Failure Mode 'Poor serviceability'. Exact match data exists for the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), failure mode and failure cause but for the closely related system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' with functions providing installation space for sensors or cable routing. Due to the close relation of Crankcase and CCV system (contact interface), assembly and design factors impacting serviceability are expected to share similar preventive and detective measures. Measures from CCV (blow-by) system context are applicable without modifications. No direct data for Crankcase + the exact function, failure mode and cause combination is found, but transferring measures from very similar context in same product category is technically valid per rules."
CCV (blow-by) system design,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'CCV (blow-by) system' (function context is absorptive to 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system' in crankcase as the element interfacing CCV system). The failure cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design' and failure mode 'Poor serviceability' fully match entries related to the 'Provides installation space for sensors' and 'Provides installation space for cable routing' functions within the CCV (blow-by) system component causing 'Poor serviceability'. The retrieved data contains multiple consistent preventive and detective measures tied specifically to this failure cause and failure mode under the same product and subsystem.

Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system element is 'Crankcase' with function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system' and failure cause is 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)', whereas all retrieved direct exact match data pertains to 'CCV (blow-by) system' element itself. However, since 'Crankcase' and 'CCV (blow-by) system' are tightly coupled within the Engine Block subsystem and the failure cause and failure mode context of 'Poor serviceability' due to 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' is essentially the same, applicable measures from the CCV system poor serviceability context are transferable to support the crankcase context for this failure cause. Measures specifically related to maintenance actions and monitoring are valid for serviceability related maintenance causes where the Crankcase interfaces with the CCV (blow-by) system. No contradictory or irrelevant information prevents transfer, and the product category, subsystem and failure cause align well."

The retrieved context includes direct preventive and detective measures addressing the same failure cause in the exact product and subsystem context, despite slight naming variation between 'Crankcase' and 'CCV (blow-by) system' as system elements, they functionally relate and data explicitly matches subsystems and failure modes/causes. Therefore, only the retrieved context data for preventive and detective measures is used, fitting specifically to design for vibration addressing lack of structural support causing sensor failure."

Retrieved data shows exact failure cause and failure mode association but mostly on CCV (blow-by) system element and on other engine block components (e.g., front end housing) with similar failure cause and failure mode, all within the same product category and subsystem. Measures for 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' are consistent and transferable as the fundamental design and assembly principles apply similarly for structural support failures impacting sensor/system interface. The exact Crankcase + contact to CCV system context is not directly listed, but the same failure cause and mode for very similar system elements in the same subsystem and product category justify SIMILAR_CONTEXT decision and use of relevant measures from CCV (blow-by) system and related components."

Measures retrieved relate explicitly to the same cause and failure mode and are consistent with FMEA standards. Despite slight variation of system element name (Crankcase vs CCV system), the failure cause relates directly to the CCV (blow-by) system design, which is the cause in retrieved data and applicable here.

Preventive and detective measures are taken from retrieved exact matching and highly relevant FMEA data."

Preventive and detective measures are directly available from retrieved context and are specific to the failure cause and failure mode in the exact target context."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system element is 'Crankcase' providing structural support in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Assembly process / Design for assembly'. The retrieved data shows exact matches for similar failure cause, mode, and subsystem but mostly on similar engine block elements (e.g., 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'). As these components share the functional context of providing structural support in the same engine block subsystem and have the same failure cause, the preventive and detective measures from these similar elements are applicable and transferred, with adjustment to the crankcase context. No directly matching measures for crankcase/assembly process were retrieved, so by system similarity rules, the similar context measures are selected and are consistent with preventing and detecting assembly/design failures affecting structural support."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is the 'Gas Engine Type 4' product with the 'Engine Block' subsystem and system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', and failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly'. The retrieved data includes multiple entries for the same product and subsystem and failure cause, but for very closely related structural support elements such as 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' which are part of the engine block and provide structural support. The failure mode and cause match exactly, but the system element differs slightly (crankcase vs front housing or rear cover). Given the very similar system element identity within the same subsystem and product, the preventive and detective measures from these closely related matches are transferable and applicable to the crankcase context because structural support issues due to assembly/design will be addressed similarly across these engine block components. The preventive measures focus on involvement of production, controls & hardware, and service teams in design process, which is applicable to crankcase to reduce assembly process/design related failures. The detective measures emphasize assembly testing, endurance run inspections, and testbench functional and overload tests, which are suitable for detecting structural support deficiencies after assembly. Thus, SIMILAR_CONTEXT is appropriate with these measures transferred and validated for relevance."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is for 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', and failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly'. The retrieved data contains multiple exact matches for the same product and subsystem but for different system elements (e.g., 'Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)') with exactly the same function, failure mode, and failure cause. These elements are part of the same subsystem and share very similar structural support functions within the engine block. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from these similar contexts are applicable to the crankcase as well, as they address the same failure cause and failure mode in similar structural support components and are all within the Gas Engine Type 4 product category. No direct data for the crankcase was found, so measures are transferred from similar system elements. Preventive measures are focused on involving relevant teams into design process to reduce assembly/design errors. Detective measures mainly rely on assembly and endurance testing to find failures after occurrence in combination with functional and performance tests. No contradictory or irrelevant measures appear in the transferred data."
Bolted joint design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', and failure cause 'Bolted joint design'. The retrieved context contains multiple entries for the same product and subsystem but with system elements closely related to structural support (e.g., 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)') with identical failure mode and cause. Since these system elements differ from the exact target 'Crankcase' but share the same system element identity category (structural housing/engine block components providing support), function, failure mode and failure cause, this qualifies as SIMILAR_CONTEXT. Measures for bolt joint design in these closely related structural components are applicable and technically relevant to the crankcase context. However, no exact context entry for 'Crankcase' with this failure mode and cause is found, thus exact measures for 'Crankcase' system element cannot be used. Preventive measures and detective measures from these similar contexts are transferred maintaining technical correctness and relevance."
Bolted joint design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Bolted joint design'. The closely matching retrieved data shows multiple entries with the same product, subsystem, function, failure mode, and failure cause but for parts highly similar in function and context, e.g., 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', both within Engine Block subsystem and related to structural support and bolted joint design. Because there is no exact match on system element 'Crankcase' but there is strong similarity in system element identity (all structural support components with bolted joints in Engine Block of Gas Engine Type 4), the preventive and detective measures from these similar system elements can be transferred and applied to the crankcase in the Engine Block subsystem. These measures are applicable because the bolted joint design principles and verification methods used for structural support components in the same subsystem and product category logically apply to the crankcase element as well. No contradictory or context-invalid measures are found, so these measures are relevant, consistent, and technically correct."
Bolted joint design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', and failure cause 'Bolted joint design' is not exactly matched in the retrieved data because the exact system element 'Crankcase' with this exact failure mode and cause combination is not found; however, very close and highly similar contexts exist for other engine block elements such as 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', both having the same failure mode and cause with identical failure effects including 'Loosening of bolts'. The bolted joint design failure cause preventive measures and detective measures from these analogous components apply and are technically valid for the 'Crankcase' under the same subsystem and product category. Thus, the measures from these similar contexts can be transferred safely and meaningfully to the target context."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Crankcase design'. Retrieved data contains exact failure cause and mode but system element varies slightly (Front end housing (damper housing) and Rear end cover (flywheel side)) within the same subsystem and product. Since all are part of the Engine Block in Gas Engine Type 4 and share the same failure cause and mode, preventive and detective measures are transferable and applicable with adjustments for naming. No direct exact matches for Crankcase system element and exact failure mode in retrieved data, so measures for similarly-contextualized system elements in Engine Block are used."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Crankcase design'. Direct exact matches for crankcase with this failure mode and cause do not exist, but closely related similar system elements within the same product and subsystem (Front end housing (damper housing) and Rear end cover (flywheel side)) with the same failure mode, failure cause, and function provide extensive preventive measures. The similarity of function and failure cause is high within the engine block structural components, allowing measure transfer with technical relevance. Preventive measures related to design, simulation, specification, and engineering analyses are consistent and applicable. Detective measures are present for the combination of failure mode and failure cause but linked to related elements and effects like damage, loosening bolts, and lack of stiffness; these often involve assembly tests and endurance run inspections for such structural insufficiencies. Measures requiring adaptation to the crankcase context are supported by references such as 'Reference to crankcase design:'. Therefore, transferred preventive and detective measures are appropriate and applicable for the target context."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Crankcase design', failure effect 'Loosening of bolts'. The retrieved data contains multiple exact matches of failure cause 'Crankcase design' with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' within the Engine Block subsystem but mostly for related elements like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'. Since the system element 'Crankcase' is closely related spatially and functionally to these elements in the same subsystem and product, and the failure cause and mode match exactly, we consider this a SIMILAR_CONTEXT case (using measures from different closely related system elements in same subsystem/product context). Notably, preventive measures are well populated but no direct detective measures are listed specifically for this combination of failure mode and failure cause in the crankcase. However, detective measures linked to this failure cause and failure mode in closely related elements include assembly tests and endurance runs. All preventive and detective measures are directly from retrieved data, no new measures invented."
Front/End cover design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system element 'Crankcase' belongs to the same subsystem 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' and has the same failure mode ('Insufficient structural support') and failure cause ('Front/End cover design') as multiple entries for the closely related system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)'. Although the exact system element name differs, the functional roles and failure causes overlap significantly within the same subsystem and product, supporting transfer of measures."
Front/End cover design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase as system element, function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', and failure cause 'Front/End cover design'. The retrieved data mostly matches on Product, Subsystem, Failure Mode, and Failure Cause but the system element in the retrieved data is consistently 'Front end housing (damper housing)' instead of 'Crankcase'. Both are part of the Engine Block subsystem and share the failure cause 'Front/End cover design' leading to insufficient structural support and lack of stiffness, so transfer of preventive and detective measures is valid and applicable with this naming variation."
Front/End cover design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context matches the product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), function (Provides structural support), failure mode (Insufficient structural support), and failure cause (Front/End cover design) exactly. However, system element differs in naming: target 'Crankcase' vs. retrieved 'Front end housing (damper housing)'. These represent closely related core structural components in the same subsystem and product. Measures related to 'Front/End cover design' causing insufficient structural support with loosening of bolts effect are applicable and transferable under the product category and subsystem similarity, considering the functional equivalency and failure cause. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from retrieved data for 'Front/End cover design' failure cause with failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' are applicable to 'Crankcase'."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a 'Gas Engine Type 4' Engine Block subsystem focusing on the 'Crankcase' element providing structural support and facing a failure mode of 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'. Retrieved data contains many exact matches for this failure cause and mode but mostly for other elements like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', which are in the same subsystem and product but different system elements. Since the system element differs yet the context (product category, subsystem, function, failure mode, and failure cause) remains similar and applicable, preventive and detective measures are transferred from these similar contexts. Measures related to geometry tolerance issues for insufficient structural support across related engine block elements align well logically and technically for the Crankcase. Thus, measures from matching failure mode and cause for other engine block elements in Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable with naming variation considered."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, system element Crankcase, function Provides structural support for internal components with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'. Exact match for system element 'Crankcase' with all other attributes does not exist in retrieved data, but multiple similar contexts for failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' and failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in the same product, subsystem, and function are available for 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', which are also engine block structural components with very similar function and failure mode. Additionally, preventive measures and detective measures for the same failure cause and failure mode on these elements use highly transferable corrective actions such as design to specification, tolerance stackup, involving teams in design, simulation usage, and assembly test for detection. Therefore, these measures are applicable to Crankcase for insufficient structural support due to geometry tolerances according to the similarity rules and technical sense."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' leading to 'Insufficient structural support' and resulting in 'Loosening of bolts' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' engine block is not exactly matched in the retrieved context (no direct FMEA data on 'Crankcase' with exact failure mode and cause). However, similar failure causes and modes are well covered for closely related system elements within the same product and subsystem, such as 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' components providing structural support. These share the same product, subsystem, function, failure mode and failure cause with only the system element differing. Therefore, preventive and detective measures applicable to the same failure cause and mode for those elements are transferable and valid to the 'Crankcase' as the core structural element, given the identical product category and system context. Preventive measures address the failure cause exclusively and detective measures address the special failure mode/cause combination. No new measures beyond the context data have been introduced."
Pipe design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase' with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Pipe design'. Retrieved data has exact matching failure cause and failure mode but system element is 'Front end housing (damper housing)', a closely related structural component within the same subsystem and product. Measures for 'Pipe design' causing 'Insufficient structural support' are transferable and applicable to 'Crankcase' as they address structural design aspects relevant to both elements in engine block. No exact match data found for Crankcase element itself with this failure mode and cause, so SIMILAR_CONTEXT is applied."
Pipe design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is for the Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Pipe design'. The retrieved data shows multiple exact matches for the same product, subsystem, failure mode and failure cause but on the closely related system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' with the exact same function and failure cause/mode. Because the crankcase and front end housing are both part of the engine block structural system and the failure cause and failure mode are identical, the preventive and detective measures are applicable and transferable. No measures are found specifically for the crankcase with this failure cause but the front end housing provides extensive relevant measures that align technically and contextually, without conflicts or domain mismatch. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are generated based on those retrieved for the same failure mode and failure cause albeit on a similar system element within the same subsystem and product category."
Pipe design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', Function 'Provides structural support for internal components', Failure Mode 'Insufficient structural support', Failure Cause 'Pipe design', and Failure Effect 'Loosening of bolts'. The retrieved context contains EXACT matches of Product, Subsystem, Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, Failure Effect but for the System Element 'Front end housing (damper housing)'. 'Front end housing (damper housing)' is a different system element but within the same subsystem and product category. The failure mode and failure cause combinations are identical. Therefore, according to the decision matrix, preventive and detective measures can be transferred if applicable. The preventive measures for 'Pipe design' causing 'Insufficient structural support' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' are all design and analysis related methods: 'Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'Bolt joint calculation (VDI2230)', 'MBS' and '1D simulation'. These are valid and technically applicable also for crankcase structural support related to pipe design. Detective measures recorded were 'Assembly test', 'Endurance run - inspection of parts and fluids', and 'Bolted joint preload measurement' targeting detection of loosening bolt conditions resulting from pipe design issues. No conflicting data or measures are found; thus, these can be assigned as valid for the crankcase context with the given failure cause and mode. Hence, preventive and detective measures are transferred from the most closely matching context in the retrieved data."
Water jacket design,"EXACT_MATCH based on exact match of Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Provides structural support for internal components), Failure Mode (Too low coolant feed to cylinder head), and Failure Cause (Water jacket design). The retrieved data contains specific preventive measures and one detective measure directly applicable without ambiguity."
Coolant type and maintenance,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function 'Provides structural support for internal components', failure mode 'Too low coolant feed to cylinder head', and failure cause 'Coolant type and maintenance') exactly matches multiple retrieved data entries in the same product, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause combination. Therefore, only preventive and detective measures from this exact context are used."
Intake manifold and V-room design,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context exactly matches retrieved data on Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head), Failure Mode (Inconsistent gas density across cylinders) and Failure Cause (Intake manifold and V-room design). Available preventive and detective measures directly address this failure cause and mode in the precise system context."
Cylinder head interface design,"EXACT_MATCH because the Target system context matches exactly with retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', Function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', Failure Mode 'Inconsistent gas density across cylinders', and Failure Cause 'Cylinder head interface design'. Preventive and detective measures are directly available from retrieved context for this exact match."
V-room design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target context is 'Gas Engine Type 4' product with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' with function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' failing by 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' due to 'V-room design'. The retrieved data mostly covers the 'V-room insulation' system element (which conceptually relates to the V-room area or structure including interfaces in the crankcase area) with the same function, failure mode and failure cause. Measures related to 'V-room design' causing 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' are applicable as the crankcase function is closely linked and the failure cause is the same design of the V-room influencing flow characteristics. The preventive and detective measures from 'V-room insulation' for the failure cause 'V-room design' and failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' can be transferred and applied with technical correctness to the 'Crankcase' element and function."
Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, with Failure Mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and Failure Cause 'Material selection'. The retrieved data contains exact failure mode and failure cause matches but on the closely related 'V-room insulation' system element within the same subsystem and product. Based on system similarity definitions, Crankcase and V-room insulation are different system elements within the same subsystem with the same function context related to gas flow to cylinder and the identical failure mode and cause. Therefore, preventive and detective measures applicable to V-room insulation are transferable and applicable for the Crankcase element in the same context."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' and failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' relate to the Crankcase in the Engine Block subsystem of the Gas Engine Type 4 product, but the retrieved data is for the 'V-room insulation' component, a different system element with a similar function (allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head). Both share the same product and subsystem, and system element is a closely related component functionally involved in gas flow to the cylinder, so measures can be logically transferred and applied to the Crankcase element context."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), and Failure Mode (Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder) match exactly, but the System Element differs (Crankcase requested vs. V-room insulation in retrieved data). Both components relate to gas mixture routing within the same subsystem and product, sharing the same function context. The failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' is consistent. The preventive and detective measures provided for V-room insulation in the same failure mode and cause can be reasonably applied or adapted to Crankcase under the same failure cause in the same subsystem and product category."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The requested failure context is for the Gas Engine Type 4 product within the Engine Block subsystem and Crankcase system element, focusing on the function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' caused by 'Combustion system'. Exact match data is not available for 'Crankcase' and this function, but corresponding failure mode and cause data is extensively available for the similar system element 'V-room insulation' within the same subsystem and product. Since 'V-room insulation' and 'Crankcase' both relate to gas mixture flow paths in the engine block, and the failure mode and cause are identical, preventive and detective measures can be transferred reliably from 'V-room insulation' to 'Crankcase' after verifying technical consistency. Measures related to the combustion system causing flow disturbance of gas to cylinder from the 'V-room insulation' component are applicable and appropriate for 'Crankcase' with this failure cause and effect in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Crankcase design' with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' system element is not available exactly in the retrieved data. However, several exact matches exist for the same failure cause and failure mode but related to the 'V-room insulation' system element in the same subsystem and product, which is closely functionally related (both involved in routing gas mixture in the engine block). Therefore, the preventive and detective measures for 'V-room insulation' with identical failure cause, failure mode, and product/subsystem are transferrable and applicable to the 'Crankcase' element for these failure modes, due to similar gas flow routing functions and design considerations. No specific measures were found directly on 'Crankcase' for this failure mode, but also crankcase design causes are documented for other failure modes (oil leakage, insufficient clearance, etc.) but those are not addressing 'flow disturbance of gas'. Hence, to satisfy the MEASURE REQUIREMENTS, only measures from the retrieved data for 'V-room insulation' element with the same failure cause and failure mode are used here."
V-room design,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context exactly matches the retrieved data context in product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase function via V-room design as part of V-room insulation), function (provide gas mixture route to cylinder head), failure mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder), and failure cause (V-room design). The retrieved data provides precise preventive and detective measures for this failure cause and mode in the exact same system context, so only these measures from retrieved data are used."
Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase'. The provided context data contains many entries for a very similar function—providing or allowing gas/air/mixture flow to the cylinder head—mostly related to 'V-room insulation' which is a closely related functional element in the same subsystem and product. Both share the failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' and failure cause 'Material selection'. Although the exact system element is 'Crankcase' in the target and 'V-room insulation' in the retrieved data, these elements are functionally and subsystem-wise very close and both involve gas mixture flow routing in the engine block. Therefore, preventive and detective measures for the same failure mode and cause in 'V-room insulation' are applicable and transferable to 'Crankcase'. No contradictory context found. Detective measures in the retrieved context are available, although some are null. Hence preventive and detective measures from this close context (V-room insulation, Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block) for 'Material selection' failure cause and 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' failure mode are adopted."
Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is the 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Crankcase' system element with a function to 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', and failure cause 'Design for maintenance'. Retrieved data exactly matching this failure cause ('Design for maintenance') with the same failure mode is available but for the system element 'V-room insulation' not 'Crankcase'. The 'Crankcase' is closely related to mixture routing and part of the same subsystem and product, so preventive and detective measures for 'Design for maintenance' causing this failure mode in 'V-room insulation' are applicable to the 'Crankcase'. No retrieved measures are found for 'Crankcase' element explicitly at this failure cause and failure mode. Also, 'Design for maintenance' preventive and detective measures for various failure modes in 'V-room insulation' directly address maintainability issues affecting the mixture supply. Measures from 'CCV (blow-by) system' for 'Design for maintenance' failure cause also exist but relate to 'Lack of structure for support' and other failure modes unrelated to mixture insufficiency, thus less applicable. Therefore, applying measures from the highly similar system element 'V-room insulation' with the same function and failure mode is justified and relevant for the 'Crankcase' element. Preventive: 'Design guideline (maintainability)'. Detective: 'Validation plan for V-room', 'Assembly trial', 'Field Validation (Component inspection)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)'."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' matches exactly, but the system element 'Crankcase' differs from retrieved context system element 'V-room insulation' though both belong to the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block) and produce the same failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder'. Measures applicable to the failure cause can be transferred and adapted since they deal with casting tolerance issues of the crankcase impacting gas mixture delivery."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the provided target system context is for the 'Crankcase' system element with function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' and failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' due to 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)'. There is no exact match for this failure mode and cause on the crankcase in the retrieved context data. However, multiple exact and similar failure modes with the exact failure cause exist for the 'V-room insulation' component in the same subsystem and product, sharing the same failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' or variants during transient engine operation) and cause ('Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)'). The function is similar (allowing air/gas/mixture to cylinder head), and the failure effect (drop in engine performance) is the same. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are transferred from 'V-room insulation' to the crankcase for this failure cause and failure mode, assuming applicability given the same subsystem and product category. Measures specifically addressing crankcase design related to the transient operation failure cause are also considered for relevance if they align with preventing or detecting failure causes linked to transient operation and insufficient mixture delivery. No measures addressing different failure modes or different failure causes are considered. Preventive measures must address only the failure cause (transient engine operation start-up/cool down). Detective measures address the combination of failure mode and failure cause as requested. Measures from unrelated failure modes or different causes were not used."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function to provide gas mixture route to cylinder head, failure mode insufficient air/gas/mixture to a cylinder, and failure cause combustion system. The retrieved data contain multiple exact matches for the failure mode and cause but associated mostly with the V-room insulation component serving the same function within the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4. Crankcase and V-room insulation are closely related elements in the same subsystem concerning air/gas mixture flow. The failure cause (combustion system) and failure mode are identical. Considering the system element naming variation and functional closeness within the same subsystem and product, the preventive and detective measures from V-room insulation context are applicable and transferable to the Crankcase. Measures related to Combustion system cause for insufficient air/gas/mixture failure mode are specifically given and suitable for this target context."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system element 'Crankcase' with function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', and failure cause 'Crankcase design' matches the failure cause and mode context retrieved for the closely related system element 'V-room insulation' in 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Given system element identity similarity (both pertain to crankcase-related gas mixture routing), and product & subsystem exact match, preventive and detective measures from 'V-room insulation' context are applicable and relevant for the target 'Crankcase'."
V-room design,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, function to provide gas mixture route to cylinder head, failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation', failure cause 'V-room design') corresponds directly and exactly to the failure mode and cause data available for the 'V-room insulation' system element in the same product, subsystem, function, failure mode, and failure cause. The slight difference in system element naming ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation') is acceptable as the V-room insulation is integral in the crankcase for mixture flow. The retrieved preventive and detective measures are directly applicable without modification."
Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is the Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'Material selection'. Exact matches in retrieved data exist only for the V-room insulation element with the same function, failure mode, and failure cause. Because the system element 'Crankcase' is different from 'V-room insulation' but shares the same subsystem, function, failure mode, and failure cause within the same product and product category, measures from V-room insulation are transferable and applicable. The preventive measures address material selection relevant to gas mixture flow, and detective measures focus on functional performance testing and validation for the V-room, which aligns with detecting material-related flow insufficiencies. No conflicting data is found for direct crankcase material selection causing this failure mode, so using V-room measures is appropriate and consistent with FMEA standards."
Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' for function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' and failure cause 'Design for maintenance'. Retrieved data contains exact matching failure cause and failure mode in very close system element 'V-room insulation' in the same subsystem and product, which provides gas mixture to cylinder head. The 'Crankcase' is upstream in flow path. The failure cause and mode context is the same functionally despite slight difference in system element naming. Therefore, preventive and detective measures applicable to 'V-room insulation' for this failure cause and mode are applicable for transfer and use for 'Crankcase'."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context 'Crankcase' with failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' causing 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches failure cause and system element identity but the retrieved data mostly references the 'V-room insulation' system element that also serves the function of allowing air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head in the same subsystem, product, and failure mode/cause context. Measures are transferable and applicable because the failure cause and its relation to casting tolerances impacting gas mixture flow applies functionally to Crankcase related components influencing the gas mixture route similarly."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","EXACT_MATCH because the target context matches exactly with a failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' in the 'Crankcase' system element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although retrieved measures are mainly for the closely related 'V-room insulation' system element with exact match of function, failure mode, cause, and product, the 'Crankcase' is strongly related as the gas mixture route path and shares identical cause and mode context within the same subsystem and product. Thus, measures for 'Transient engine operation' taken from the 'V-room insulation' element are applicable via SIMILAR_CONTEXT rules but transfer-worthy for 'Crankcase'. No direct measures retrieved from 'Crankcase' for this failure mode/cause pair, hence similar context transfer is applied carefully for relevance."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Combustion system' and failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' are given within the same product 'Gas Engine Type 4' and subsystem 'Engine Block' but the system element differs ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'). However, both components are part of the gas mixture path and functionally relate to the 'Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head'. Measures from the 'V-room insulation' component context are applicable and technically reasonable to transfer to 'Crankcase' for this cause and failure mode combination."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT based on exact matching system element (Crankcase), failure mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation), failure cause (Crankcase design) but difference in system element naming (target: Crankcase vs retrieved: V-room insulation). Both belong to the same subsystem (Engine Block), product (Gas Engine Type 4), and product category (gas engines). Measures related to 'Crankcase design' causing insufficient mixture are applicable and meaningful to the 'Crankcase' system element context. No detected measures for exactly the Crankcase element with this failure mode/failure cause combination were found, but strong evidence from very similar context (V-room insulation element allowing mixture flow identified with crankcase design failure cause) allows transfer of preventive and detective measures. This is consistent with FMEA standards to transfer from similar context when exact element differs in naming but functionally strongly related."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)","EXACT_MATCH because the target system context matches exactly retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', Function 'Sealing against leakages oil', Failure Mode 'Oil leakage', and Failure Cause 'Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)'. Measures generated use only the retrieved data from this exact context as required."
Position of blow-by extraction,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with the 'Crankcase' element, focusing on the function 'Sealing against leakages oil' and failure mode 'Oil leakage' caused by 'Position of blow-by extraction' exactly matches multiple retrieved context entries. Preventive and detective measures are directly available from the retrieved data respecting the exact context, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause."
Bolted joint design,"EXACT_MATCH because retrieved data exactly matches target system context: Product is 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem is 'Engine Block', System Element is 'Crankcase', Function is 'Sealing against leakages oil', Failure Mode is 'Oil leakage', and Failure Cause is 'Bolted joint design'. Preventive and detective measures are taken only from this exact match data for this failure cause."
Liquid sealing degradation,"EXACT_MATCH because retrieved data includes the exact target product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage), and failure cause (Liquid sealing degradation). The preventive and detective measures are derived exclusively from this exact context data."
Position of blow-by system,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical context in product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage), and failure cause (Position of blow-by system). Measures are directly taken from retrieved context data with exact matching entries."
O-ring aging,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Crankcase, Function: Sealing against leakages oil, Failure Mode: Oil leakage, Failure Cause: O-ring aging) exactly matches multiple entries in the retrieved context data with consistent product, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause."
Thermal boundary conditions,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context exactly matches retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', Function 'Sealing against leakages oil', Failure Mode 'Oil leakage', and Failure Cause 'Thermal boundary conditions'. Measures must be taken exclusively from this exact context."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)","EXACT_MATCH based on identical Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Sealing against leakages oil), Failure Mode (Oil leakage), and Failure Cause (Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)) in retrieved data. The retrieved context provides multiple exactly matching preventive measures and associated detective measures for the specific failure effect 'Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure'."
Position of blow-by extraction,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, Sealing against leakages oil, Oil leakage, Position of blow-by extraction, Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure) exactly matches retrieved data context. Preventive and detective measures are directly available from retrieved context for this exact combination."
Bolted joint design,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Crankcase, Function: Sealing against leakages oil, Failure Mode: Oil leakage, Failure Cause: Bolted joint design, Failure Effect: Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure) exactly matches multiple retrieved context data entries with preventive and detective measures recorded specifically for this same exact context."
