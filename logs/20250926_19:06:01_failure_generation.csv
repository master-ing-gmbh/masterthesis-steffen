Receives oil from turbocharger oil circuit,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system has the function 'Receives oil from turbocharger oil circuit'. There is no exact or similar failure mode information directly available from the retrieved context for this precise function and system element combination. Most retrieved failure modes relate to oil concentration, flow, or contamination issues in related subsystems like the 'Crankcase' or 'CCV (blow-by) system', or other engine block elements but not explicitly for the 'Front end housing' receiving oil from the turbocharger circuit. Although these contexts relate to oil management in the engine block subsystem, the functional role here (receiving oil from turbocharger oil circuit) differs in flow path, component design, and potential failure mechanisms. Therefore, a different context approach was taken, leveraging general technical knowledge of turbocharger oil supply path, engine housing elements, and multi-perspective brainstorming to generate technically accurate failure modes, effects, and causes consistent with FMEA standards. The failure modes include loss of oil delivery, flow limitation, leakage, contamination ingress, and structural damage affecting the oil receiving function, with effects on oil supply reliability and engine durability and causes spanning design flaws, assembly issues, wear, contamination, and maintenance neglect."

This is an exact match because the product, subsystem, system element, and function align perfectly. The failure modes and causes in the context include contamination of coolant due to casting paint over time, which impacts coolant lifetime. Additional relevant failure modes related to coolant leakage or flow interruptions (though at the same or adjacent components) have been carefully excluded because they pertain to different system elements. Therefore, following the EXACT_MATCH rules, only failure mode(s) drawn from the retrieved data for this precise component function are used without new invention."

Additionally, there is direct retrieved failure mode data for the Rear end cover related to a similar sensor installation function that informs about failure cause and mode patterns (e.g., 'Incorrect positioning of sensors'). This supports a confident application of failure mode reasoning from structurally similar components to the Rear end cover (flywheel side). Hence, SIMILAR_CONTEXT is selected, enabling transfer and adaptation of failures notably 'Lack of structure for support', 'Cable breakage to initial support', 'Insufficient structural support', and 'Incorrect positioning of sensors' to the Rear end cover (flywheel side). The generated failure modes consider cable routing and sensor installation functions and adapted failure causes regarding design, assembly, geometry tolerances, and vibration aspects confirmed in related elements."

Provides maintainance space for removing camshaft,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with reasoning: No retrieved data contains exact or similar context failure mode information for the Rear end cover (flywheel side) providing maintenance space for removing camshaft in the Gas Engine Type 4. While retrieved data pertains mostly to sealing, leakage, lubrication, and assembly failures in the Engine Block subsystem (crankcase, piston cooling jet, CCV system), none represent the exact system element and function combination for this specific cover and its maintenance space role. Given the functional uniqueness (providing a physical space for maintenance/removal) and the structural/mechanical nature of the element, this requires creative and technically grounded brainstorming to generate relevant failure modes, effects, and causes. Similar subsystem elements with service space or cover functions are not available in the data, so fresh technical failure analysis is applied following FMEA standards and multi-perspective brainstorming."

Therefore, only failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes found in the retrieved data from this exact context are used, ensuring technical correctness and adherence to FMEA standards without generating any new failure modes or causes."
Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data exactly matches the target system context for the Gas Engine Type 4 product, Engine Block subsystem, CCV (blow-by) system element, and the specific function 'Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation'. The failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes are directly sourced from validated data pertaining to this exact element and function. No new failure modes, effects or causes outside the retrieved context should be generated."
