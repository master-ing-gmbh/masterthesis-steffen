Sealing of main oil gallery,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target product 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs slightly from the retrieved product 'Gas Engine Type 4', but both share the same Product Category (Gas Engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)) and identical Function ('Sealing of main oil gallery'). Given the strong match in function and system element within a highly similar product family and identical subsystem, failure modes, effects, and causes from the retrieved data are applicable. Minor adaptations not required as product similarity is high and function/system element combination is exact aside from product version. Therefore, failure modes and causes are transferred and slightly adapted in terminology to reflect the target context without inventing new failure modes."
Opens at a desired opening pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' performing the exact same function 'Opens at a desired opening pressure' as the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem context (engine block), differing only in the product generation/version. Therefore, failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes from the retrieved context are fully applicable with adjustment to potential changes in design maturity or updates between versions. No fundamentally new failure modes are needed beyond the detailed ones for Gas Engine Type 4; however, the modes can be transferred directly with relevance maintained."
Directs oil to the piston gallery (e.g. bundling),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' performing the function 'Directs oil to the piston gallery (e.g. bundling)'. The retrieved data corresponds to 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem, system element, and function. As the product types differ but are similar gas engine types within the same product category and subsystem context, applying the failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes from the retrieved data is valid. Minor contextual adaptations are considered unnecessary here because the function and design context are highly analogous. This is a straightforward case of SIMILAR_CONTEXT between closely related gas engine product series sharing the same PCJ function. Therefore, all technical failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 PCJ function data are fully transferable and consistent with the target system context."
Clearance to all neighboring systems,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved context data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem ('Engine Block'), same system element ('Piston cooling jet (PCJ)'), and identical function ('Clearance to all neighboring systems'). The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' which is a direct evolution or similar variant within the same product category (gas engines). The system element identity and function match exactly. Given this high similarity but different exact product type, failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 can be transferred and adapted to Gas Engine Type 6. Differences between engine types mostly concern geometry and tolerances but fundamental failure mechanisms remain consistent. No additional new failure modes outside those given in the retrieved data are generated in order to maintain consistency with available validated data, but logical adaptation in terminology is applied. Therefore, SIMILAR_CONTEXT and transferred failure modes from Gas Engine Type 4 PCJ 'Clearance' function are presented with their causes and effects aligned technically to Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Close at the desired pressure (minimize hysteresis),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', and function 'Close at the desired pressure (minimize hysteresis)', which is exactly the same system element and function but from a different product version (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6). Both belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and share the same technical function and context. Therefore, the failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable and transferable to Gas Engine Type 6. Minor adaptation to acknowledge potential product version differences is done by preserving all retrieved failure modes and causes as they logically remain relevant. No additional failure modes are added beyond those in the retrieved data, respecting the given source limitations and exact function-element matching."
Contact to crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly' and function 'Contact to crankcase' closely matches the retrieved data context for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem and system element with the identical function. The product category (gas engines) and functional context remain consistent, allowing direct transfer and analytical adaptation of failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes. Minor adaptations account for potential design or manufacturing evolutions between engine types, but all retrieved failure data remain valid. No new failure modes are introduced beyond those found in the retrieved data, per the EXACT_MATCH restriction, but failure mode descriptions are adapted for the updated product type. The failure effects and causes are technically consistent and directly transferable, thus fulfilling the SIMILAR_CONTEXT criteria effectively."
Clearance to crankcase,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context is for 'Gas Engine Type 6', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Cylinder liner assembly' system element performing the function 'Clearance to crankcase'. The retrieved data contains multiple failure modes, effects, and causes exactly matching product category, subsystem, system element, and function but from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Given the same product category and exact subsystem-element-function combination, and allowed naming consistency (cylinder liner assembly is identical), these can be used directly without inventing new modes. Also, failure modes like 'Liner contact disruption at top/bottom', 'Coolant leakage to oil pan' are functionally and technically suitable. Thus, the content is based exclusively on retrieved exact context data for failure mode generation."
Provide coolant flow route to liner and cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the 'Cylinder liner assembly' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem providing the function 'Provide coolant flow route to liner and cylinder head'. The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same product category (gas engines), same subsystem and element, with exactly matching function. Although the product variant differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), the subsystem, system element, and function are identical, allowing direct transfer of applicable failure modes, effects, and causes. Minor adaptation for possible Type 6 specifics could be done, but no contradictory information exists. All listed failure modes, causes, and effects are directly relevant and technically correct for Type 6 engine context as well, given similar operational principles. Therefore, the SIMILAR_CONTEXT approach is applied with direct reuse and slight contextual adaption for clarity in the Type 6 environment."
Sealing of coolant jacket,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data pertains to 'Gas Engine Type 4', with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', and function 'Sealing of coolant jacket', which exactly matches the target system element and function but from a different product variant (Type 4 vs Type 6) within the same product category (Gas Engine). The functional environment, design principles, and failure modes are expected to be very similar and directly transferable. Minor adaptations are not required since the functional assembly and engine block context remains consistent and critical sealing requirements do not vary fundamentally between the two engine types."
Containment of combustion gases,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element Cylinder liner assembly performing containment of combustion gases. The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact same subsystem, system element, and function. Given the reasonable similarity in product category and functional context, the failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 can be transferred and analytically adapted with confidence. Minor adaptations for possible design updates or material differences in Type 6 can be internally assumed acceptable. No conflicting data is present. Other failure modes related to combustion gas leakage, liner design, and cavitation failures are directly relevant and technically consistent with the target context. Hence, failure modes, effects, and causes from the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 Cylinder liner assembly containment function are used as the base for the output."
Transmit heat to water jacket,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved failure data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' whereas the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), and share the exact same function 'Transmit heat to water jacket'. Minor evolution differences between engine versions are likely, but the fundamental thermal transfer principle and failure causes remain largely consistent. Therefore, it is valid and appropriate to transfer the failure modes, effects, and causes for the exact function and system element from Type 4 to Type 6 with analytical adaptation if required. The available retrieved data comprehensively covers all known relevant failure modes of inadequate heat transfer and its prolonged effects, with detailed causes related to coolant routing, design, coolant properties, and liner design. No additional failure modes outside those documented are indicated for this context. Hence, only slight linguistic polishing and reinterpretation for clarity as needed is applied."
Provide structural support to APR,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target product is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with exact matching subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', and function 'Provide structural support to APR'. Both products are gas engines with similar functional context of the engine block, so failure modes related to structural support and emissions are relevant with some adaptation and addition of structural failure modes from similar engine block elements. However, no failure modes other than 'High THC emissions over time' were found specifically for the cylinder liner assembly in the retrieved data. Additional failure modes related to 'structural support' (e.g. insufficient support) from closely related engine block elements have been adapted conservatively to cylinder liner assembly as they are functionally connected and provide structural integrity. Design, assembly, and tolerance-related failure causes from related elements were also transferred and adapted. No irrelevant failure modes unrelated to structural support or the cylinder liner assembly function were included."
Sealing between cylinder gasket and liner,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data corresponds to the same system element (Cylinder liner assembly) and function (Sealing between cylinder gasket and liner) within the same subsystem (Engine Block), but for Gas Engine Type 4 rather than the target Gas Engine Type 6. Since the product category (Gas Engine) and context are very similar with only a different generation or variant, the failure modes, effects, and causes are directly applicable with minor adaptation as needed for the target. All retrieved failure modes and causes align well with the function and component context, needing no invented new failure modes. Therefore, relevant failure modes such as leakage of combustion gases, high THC emissions over time, and insufficient contact scenarios can be directly transferred and adapted. Causes such as bolted joint design, geometry tolerances, gasket design, liner design, and maintenance issues remain valid and technically accurate. The failure effects on combustion leakage, emissions, and engine shutdown remain relevant for Gas Engine Type 6."
Provide load path from CH to crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) shares the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), and function ('Provide load path from CH to crankcase') as the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. The context is highly analogous, requiring transfer of applicable failure modes, effects, and causes with analytical adaptation to the likely similar but newer engine type environment rather than inventing new failure modes or causes. This ensures relevance and technical accuracy while allowing for minor engineering consideration differences between engine types."
Guidance for power unit,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Cylinder liner assembly, function Guidance for power unit) matches the function and system element exactly to the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. Both belong to the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem (Engine Block) with identical function and system element identity. Only the product version differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), which is a different product but the same context. According to the decision matrix, failure modes, effects, and causes retrieved for Gas Engine Type 4 are transferable and should be carefully adapted to Type 6. The failure mode 'Adverse piston motion' and 'Adverse piston motion over time' are applicable failure modes describing the cylinder liner assembly failing in its guidance function, and the causes and effects are valid in this updated context. No additional failure modes were found in retrieved data; thus, we transfer and slightly adapt these failure modes and causes. The failure cause terminology matches technical characteristics of cylinder liner assembly and power unit guidance. Failure effects such as engine stop due to engine damage are severe and relevant. Therefore, the exact failure mode, causes, and effects for Cylinder liner assembly guidance function from Gas Engine Type 4 are used with relevance to Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Absorption of piston loads,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data matches exactly the subsystem (Engine Block), system element identity (Cylinder liner assembly), and function (Absorption of piston loads), but the product variant is Gas Engine Type 4 instead of the target Gas Engine Type 6. Both are within the same product category (gas engines) and share very similar functional and structural contexts. Thus, failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes from Gas Engine Type 4 can be adapted and transferred reliably to Gas Engine Type 6 without loss of accuracy. The similar operating principles, load cases, and mechanical interfaces allow direct use of the retrieved failure data with minor contextual adaptation and no invention of new failure types is necessary."
Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' whereas the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), and the identical function 'Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly'. Although the product version differs, the core functional and structural element remains consistent. Thus, failure modes, effects, and causes extracted from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are highly applicable but require analytical confirmation for Type 6. Given the lack of Type 6 specific data, adaptation of known failure modes is appropriate, ensuring technical relevance. No new failure modes outside the retrieved context are introduced, respecting the guidelines for SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The failure modes mainly concern oil quantity control (too much or too little oil), which would apply similarly in the target system because of similar tribological and thermal mechanisms. Failure causes such as honing structure wear, oil type, thermal conditions, and misalignment remain valid. Failure effects include high oil consumption, piston damage, and blow-by, which are critical and relevant consequences for this function. Thus, the adapted failure analysis aligns accurately with the FMEA standards and technical context of the target system."
Directs/leads oil to lubrication system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function directing oil to lubrication system) matches the retrieved context (Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, same system element, and same function). The product type differs slightly (Type 6 vs Type 4) but same product category (gas engine) and subsystem context, so failure modes and causes from provided data are applicable and can be adapted accordingly. The retrieved failure modes, effects, and causes correspond exactly to the system element and function. No new failure modes beyond those provided are generated, but language is adjusted slightly where relevant for clarity and applicability to target system."
Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) shares the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element Identity (Crankcase), and Function (Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system) as the retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data. The slight difference in gas engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) and the matching functional context allow transfer and analytical adaptation of failure modes, effects, and causes. This similarity justifies using the retrieved data with contextual verification and addition of minor adaptations if needed, ensuring relevance and technical accuracy within the same product domain and functional scope."
Contact to cylinder head assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element with function 'Contact to cylinder head assembly'. The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact same subsystem, system element, and function. Both are gas engines in the same product category and functional context with only product generation/version difference. The function and system element context match fully, allowing transfer of failure modes, effects, and causes by analytical adaptation if necessary. The failure modes, causes, and effects from Type 4 are highly relevant and plausible for Type 6 crankcase given their functional similarity and engineering commonality. No new failure modes beyond those found are generated, but minor wording adaptation for broader applicability to Type 6 is implicit."
Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with 'Engine Block' subsystem and 'Crankcase' element performing the function 'Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly', matching the retrieved data in product category (Gas Engines), subsystem, element and function, but differs in engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4). Therefore, existing failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase for the same function are transferable with analytic adaptation and potential augmentation where needed."
Contact to CCV (blow-by) system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the product Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, and function Contact to CCV (blow-by) system matches exactly the function and system element of the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. The product is from the same product category (Gas Engine) and the subsystem and element functions are equivalent. While the exact product differs, the functional and structural aspects are close enough for direct transfer and analytical adaptation of failure modes, causes, and effects. Therefore, failure data from Gas Engine Type 4 Crankcase contacting CCV system is applicable with validation and slight adaptation to the updated engine type context, maintaining technical accuracy and completeness. No new failure modes were invented but transfer and analytical tuning of existing ones were performed as per instructions."
Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure,"EXACT_MATCH since the target product (Gas Engine Type 6), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and function (Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure) all match exactly the retrieved context from Gas Engine Type 4. The minor product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) is within the same product category and similar design philosophy. Therefore, only failure modes, effects, and causes exactly matching the retrieved context are used without generating new failure modes."
Sealing against leakages coolant,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase sealing against coolant leakage closely aligns with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element and function. Both are gas engines with a crankcase responsible for sealing against coolant leakages, making failure modes, effects, and causes highly relevant but possibly requiring slight adaptation for differences in engine type. The operational context and function are consistent within the same product category and subsystem, allowing transfer and adaptation of failure data without inventing unreferenced modes. Therefore, failure modes, effects and causes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are adapted analytically to 'Gas Engine Type 6'."
Provides structural support for internal components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' performing the function 'Provides structural support for internal components'. The retrieved data comes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the identical subsystem, system element, and function. This is the same product category and very closely related engine types within the gas engine family, thus failure modes, effects, and causes can be transferred and slightly adapted if necessary. The retrieved failure modes focus on mechanical structural support issues, bolted joints, design tolerances, and assembly processes that are directly applicable. Some failure modes from other related functions (like installation space or sensor support) are not relevant here since the function strictly concerns structural support, so only relevant failure modes are included. No new failure modes are generated outside of the retrieved scope to maintain adherence to the EXACT_MATCH-like requirement within a very close similar context."
Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head'. The retrieved data refers predominantly to 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem, system element, and function. This is a closely related product variant within the same product category and functional context. Given the near-identical system element and function between Type 4 and Type 6 gas engines, failure modes, effects, and causes from the retrieved data are highly applicable. Failure modes such as inconsistent gas density, flow disturbance, insufficient gas supply to cylinders, and related sealing and interface issues are directly relevant. Minor adaptations consider possible design and operational evolutions from Type 4 to Type 6 but do not require invention of new failure modes outside retrieved data. Hence, the failure modes, effects, and causes are analytically transferred and slightly adapted to ensure relevance for Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase gas mixture routing function, maintaining FMEA standards and complete technical accuracy."
Sealing against leakages oil,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', and function 'Sealing against leakages oil'. The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem, system element, and function. Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share the identical functional context of sealing oil in the crankcase of the engine block. Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable with minor analytical adaptation related to possible design evolution or scale differences between engine types. No new failure types outside the retrieved data context were identified or required as per the exact function and element. Only adapted terminology references to Gas Engine Type 6 are considered implicit with direct transferability of the retrieved failure data."
Transmission of energy between crankcase and CCV,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase' with the same function 'Transmission of energy between crankcase and CCV'. The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with exact subsystem, element and function match except a different vehicle generation/type number. This allows direct transfer and analytical adaptation of failure modes, failure effects and failure causes while considering that slight design differences might occur, but fundamental failure mechanisms will be highly applicable."
Allow for venting locations for coolant circuit,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, Function: Allow for venting locations for coolant circuit) exactly matches the retrieved data context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, same function). Although the product type differs slightly (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category, subsystem, element, and specific function align perfectly, justifying the use of retrieved failure modes, effects, and causes without inventing new ones or extensive adaptation."
(Ensure that no air is in the coolant circuit),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data exactly matches the product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and function (Ensure that no air is in the coolant circuit). Although the product variant is Gas Engine Type 4 while the target is Gas Engine Type 6, the functional context and system element are directly comparable. According to the EXACT MATCH criteria, this is a precise functional alignment; however, since the product type is slightly different, it is classified as SIMILAR_CONTEXT to allow adjustment if necessary. The failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system' is highly relevant and can be directly transferred with validated failure causes and effects. Additional failure modes were not found for the exact function, so only those present in retrieved data are considered, meeting the requirement to not generate unknown modes. The technical terms and FMEA standards from the retrieved data apply appropriately to the target system, requiring only analytical confirmation and no new invention."
Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, with the function to provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner. The retrieved data contains exact matches for the Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), and identical Function. Despite nominal product model difference (Type 4 vs Type 6), the functional role and system element are identical and context for coolant flow and cooling function in engine block crankcase is fully aligned. Therefore, according to the decision matrix, only failure modes, effects, and causes from exact matching data are used without generating any new ones outside the retrieved set."
Sealing against leakages gas mixture,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' performing the function 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture'. The retrieved data relates to 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, and function. This represents the same product category and functional context but a different product version (Type 4 vs Type 6). Hence, failure modes, causes, and effects from the retrieved data are applicable but should be reviewed and adapted for the new version if necessary. No contradicting elements or radically different conditions exist that would reduce applicability, so direct adaptation with some engineering reasoning is appropriate."
Contact / Fit to PCJ,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase' and function 'Contact / Fit to PCJ'. The retrieved context describes similar function and system element within the same product category (gas engines) but from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Given the product type and subsystem are strongly aligned, and the system element and function match exactly, this represents a highly relevant similar context. The failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable but may require slight adaptation for Type 6 specific design features or improvements. The core failure modes related to misalignment, oil leakage, structural issues, vibration, and serviceability remain valid. Additional brainstorming is done to confirm coverage and consider any new failure modes due to possible design evolutions in Type 6. Overall, this enables transferring and adapting retrieved failure data with confidence to the target context."
Provides installation space for sensors,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', and function 'Provides installation space for sensors'. The retrieved data contains detailed failure modes, causes, and effects for the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), and identical function but in Gas Engine Type 4. This is a very close context within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem, differing only in product version/type number. Therefore, applicable failure modes, causes, and effects from Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase can be transferred and adapted to Type 6. Given the similarity, no completely new failure modes need to be created but some adaptation to reflect possible advancements or changes in requirements for Type 6 gas engine might be considered. The main failure modes identified are poor serviceability and excessive vibration impacting sensor installation. Failure causes revolve around structural design, sensor specifications, assembly procedures, and geometric tolerances. Failure effects include faulty sensor operation potentially causing engine trips, increased service effort, and sensor damage. These concepts fit naturally to the Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase context without contradiction. Hence, SIMILAR_CONTEXT action is applied with adaptation for Type 6 system."
Provides installation space for cable routing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem focusing on the 'Crankcase' element with the function 'Provides installation space for cable routing'. The retrieved data includes 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem and system element (Crankcase), identical function. This matches the product category and functional context but differs in product version. Thus, the failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase are applicable and can be transferred with analytical adaptation to Type 6. No additional contexts or unrelated elements were used, ensuring technical correctness and relevance."
Provide mechanical support and structural integrity to the front section of the engine block,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system element 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares functional and structural similarity with the retrieved data elements 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' components in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both provide mechanical support and structural integrity to respective engine front or rear sections. Although the exact product model and element naming differ, the system element role and function context are analogous within the gas engine product category and engine block subsystem. Therefore, the failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4's front and rear covers can be transferred, adapted, and augmented by engineering perspectives to match the target component."
Seal the front end of the engine block to prevent oil and coolant leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'End cover / Front housing' having the function to seal the front end of the engine block to prevent oil and coolant leakage. The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, same product category and subsystem but different system element naming variations are observed such as 'Front end housing (damper housing)' which functionally corresponds to 'End cover / Front housing'. Similar sealing functions to prevent oil and coolant leakage are described in these components. This allows transfer and adaptation of failure modes, effects, and causes while ensuring technical and functional relevance to the target context. Although not exact matches, the sealing functions and failure mechanisms in the front housing of the engine block are consistent enough for applying the retrieved failure data with adaptation to the target system. No directly retrieved data specifies failure modes for the exact system element 'End cover / Front housing' in Type 6, so adapted similar-context data is used. Additional brainstorming was applied to cover thorough failure mode types applicable for sealing function of this component in the engine block context."
Provide mounting interface for front-end components such as timing gears and belts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing' with the function 'Provide mounting interface for front-end components such as timing gears and belts'. The retrieved data predominantly covers 'Gas Engine Type 4', Engine Block subsystem with components like Front end housing (damper housing), Rear end cover (flywheel side), CCV system, and others. While the exact system element 'End cover / Front housing' with the specific function was not found, the retrieved data shows failure modes and causes for similar housing/interface elements that serve mounting and installation functions for front-end components/sensors/cable routing. The product category and subsystem context match well, and the system element identity is similar (front housing/end covers providing mounting interface). Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes related to structural integrity, serviceability, sensor positioning and assembly/design for assembly issues from the retrieved context are transferable and can be adapted to the Gas Engine Type 6 End cover / Front housing. Additional technical brainstorming is applied to incorporate the front-end mounting of timing gears and belts, which differs slightly from sensor/cable routing functions in Type 4 but remains functionally similar as a mounting interface function."
Accommodate and support sealing elements including gaskets and O-rings,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target product is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element End cover / Front housing with the function 'Accommodate and support sealing elements including gaskets and O-rings'. The retrieved data deals with Gas Engine Type 4 engine block sealing elements including front and rear end covers and sealing functions involving gaskets and O-rings. Although the exact system element name and function vary slightly (e.g., 'Front end housing (damper housing)' instead of 'End cover / Front housing'), the functional context of sealing accommodation and support is highly similar within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (engine block). Thus, failure modes, effects, and causes related to sealing degradation, loss of sealing, gasket and O-Ring aging, bolted joint design, and maintenance strategies are applicable and can be adapted analytically to the target context."
Provide installation space and mounting points for sensors at the engine front,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT as the target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with Engine Block subsystem, End cover / Front housing element providing installation space and mounting points for sensors at engine front, and the retrieved data mainly relates to Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Front end housing (damper housing) or end covers with functions to provide installation space for sensors or cable routing. This is a strongly related functional context and system element with minor differences in engine type and naming variation (end cover / front housing vs front end housing (damper housing)). Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes from retrieved data can be transferred and adapted with slight modifications to fit the target context in Gas Engine Type 6 with the same subsystem and system element function. No fundamental changes to failure types are needed, but terminology is harmonized for 'End cover / Front housing' and 'Provides installation space and mounting points for sensors'."
Guide and route cables and wiring harnesses securely through the engine front area,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target system element is 'End cover / Front housing' with function to 'Guide and route cables and wiring harnesses securely through the engine front area' in a Gas Engine Type 6, while retrieved data mostly relates to other engine block components (CCV system, Cylinder liner assembly, Front end housing/damper housing in Gas Engine Type 4) with different primary functions like sensor installation space, liner contact, oil drainage, and structural support. There is no exact or close match for the function or system element. Thus, multi-perspective brainstorming is applied to generate technically appropriate failure modes, effects, and causes specific to the cable and wiring harness routing function of the End cover / Front housing element."
Transmit applied loads from attached components to the engine block structure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and element End Cover / Front Housing, which transmits applied loads from attached components to the engine block structure. The retrieved data primarily pertains to Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, element Crankcase or similar structural components transmitting loads, supporting interfaces, or providing sealing and contact functions. Although the exact system element 'End Cover / Front Housing' with the exact function is not found, the Engine Block structural parts such as the Crankcase share the core function of load transmission and structural support. Thus, the failure modes, effects, and causes related to bolted joint design, structural integrity, sealing, misalignment, and vibration transfer from the Crankcase are technically applicable and can be analytically adapted. Specific failure modes regarding structural failure, bolt loosening, lack of sealing, misalignment, and vibration transfer to attached components are relevant to the End Cover / Front Housing since it also forms a structural interface transmitting loads and supporting assemblies. Causes related to bolted joint design, material characteristics, assembly quality, and thermal/vibration stress are universal to engine block interface elements. Therefore, the SIMILAR_CONTEXT approach applies, transferring and adapting failure modes and causes from the Crankcase context to the End Cover / Front Housing while ensuring coherence with target function and element."
Enable attachment of auxiliary devices such as the starter motor or fuel pump,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: There are no exact matches or closely similar failure mode data for the 'End cover / Front housing' element within the exact system function 'Enable attachment of auxiliary devices such as the starter motor or fuel pump' in the 'Engine Block' of a Gas Engine Type 6. The retrieved data primarily concerns related but different components within the engine block (e.g., CCV system, crankcase, V-room insulation) and their distinct functions (gas flow, sealing, serviceability, pressure). The end cover/front housing has a unique mechanical and interface function to carry and position auxiliary components, which involves specific mechanical fastening, alignment, and structural integrity requirements. Therefore, a multi-perspective brainstorming approach is necessary to generate failure modes, effects, and causes specific to this setting while leveraging general engineering knowledge of mechanical assemblies and interface elements in gas engines. The other data is not directly transferable but provides design cause inspiration (e.g., design for vibration, structural design, assembly issues)."
Maintain dimensional stability and alignment of the crankshaft front bearing support,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context is 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6', with the function of 'Maintain dimensional stability and alignment of the crankshaft front bearing support'. The retrieved data contains failure modes, effects, and causes primarily for different components (e.g., Piston Cooling Jet, Cylinder Liner Assembly, Rear End Cover, Crankcase, CCV) and different specific functions such as sealing, piston guidance, vibration, or sensor installation, mostly from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. There is no exact or sufficiently similar failure mode data concerning the 'End cover / Front housing' or the function related to dimensional stability and bearing alignment, nor the front bearing support specifically. The function here is mechanical support and precise alignment, inherently different from sealing and cooling functions seen in retrieved data. Hence, the context is DIFFERENT_CONTEXT. Multi-perspective brainstorming is applied to generate technically valid and standard-compliant failure modes, effects, and causes for the target element and function considering the critical mechanical nature of front housing and crankshaft bearing support."
Facilitate assembly and disassembly during engine manufacturing and maintenance,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element is 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the function to facilitate assembly and disassembly during engine manufacturing and maintenance. The retrieved data exclusively involves failure modes related to other engine block components (e.g., CCV system, Crankcase, V-room insulation, Cylinder liner assembly) primarily focused on sensor installation, leakage, structural support, and vibration effects in Gas Engine Type 4. There are no exact or directly analogous failure modes related to end covers/front housings, nor matching functions like assembly facilitation. The existing failure modes pertain to sealing, sensor integrity, leakage, vibration, and liner contact, which do not directly transfer or adapt well to the end cover/front housing context or its assembly/disassembly function. Therefore, a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT classification is appropriate, necessitating a multi-perspective brainstorming approach to generate technically accurate, function-driven failure modes, effects, and causes specifically related to the end cover/front housing's function in assembly/disassembly facilitation within a gas engine block subsystem."
Support engine block structural loads during operation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' focusing specifically on the 'Baseframe' component within the 'Engine Block' subsystem, which has the function to 'Support engine block structural loads during operation'. The retrieved data is exclusively related to a 'Gas Engine Type 4', and mainly covers failure modes of components such as 'Crankcase', 'Cylinder liner assembly', 'CCV (blow-by) system', and 'V-room insulation'. None of these relate directly to the 'Baseframe' element or its direct structural support function. Furthermore, there are no exact or similar matches for the 'Baseframe' supporting function or structural load bearing in the retrieved data. Therefore, by the decision matrix, this represents a DIFFERENT CONTEXT case requiring generative brainstorming and application of technical FMEA expertise specific to a baseframe structural component in a gas engine block. The baseframe is a primary structural support, analogous to a foundation supporting static and dynamic loads from the engine block during operation, exposed to mechanical loads (vibrations, thermal expansions, dynamic forces) and environmental conditions. Hence, failure modes, effects and causes must be generated accordingly considering structural engineering principles, design, manufacturing and operational influences."
Provide mounting interface for engine block assembly,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no exact or similar match for 'Baseframe' of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved data mostly refers to components such as Piston cooling jet, CCV system, rear end cover and V-room insulation within 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The function 'Provide mounting interface for engine block assembly' and system element 'Baseframe' represent a structural/support function which was not covered in retrieved data. Therefore, multi-perspective brainstorming from design, development, testing, and after-sales perspectives was applied to generate relevant failure modes, effects, and causes adhering to FMEA standards and technical accuracy."
Absorb and distribute vibrational forces from engine operation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system involves the Baseframe element in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6, with the function to absorb and distribute vibrational forces from engine operation. The retrieved data offers detailed failure mode information related to vibration issues, structural support, and design for vibration in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4, focusing on components such as the crankcase, front end housing (damper housing), and blow-by system, which are functionally similar structural parts handling vibrational loads. Despite the different engine types (Type 4 vs Type 6) and the specific system element being 'Baseframe' rather than crankcase or housing, the vibration absorption and structural support function closely align. Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes related to vibration overload, structural support failure, and assembly/process/design issues around vibration are transferable and can be adapted thoughtfully. Due to the absence of exact matches for the Baseframe element and its function, multi-perspective brainstorming is combined with adapted data from similar system elements to generate technically relevant failure modes addressing all possible vibration-related failure types as per FMEA standards."
Maintain alignment of engine components relative to baseframe,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with the subsystem Engine Block and system element Baseframe, with the function to maintain alignment of engine components relative to the baseframe. Retrieved data relate to Gas Engine Type 4 and components within the Engine Block subsystem with various alignments and structural support failures mainly at the crankcase and related interfaces. These represent closely similar mechanical alignment and structural support functions within the same product category and closely related subsystem context, allowing transfer and adaptation of failure modes, effects, and causes. The Baseframe function closely correlates to overall structural alignment support akin to the Crankcase and Front End Housing structural roles in the retrieved data, permitting application of identified failure modes such as incorrect alignment, misalignment, and vibration. Adaptations ensure failure modes specifically address the baseframe's maintenance of component alignment and related structural integrity. No exact data for Baseframe exists, so analytical adaptation and multi-perspective brainstorming fill the gap consistent with FMEA standards and the identified similar contexts."
Facilitate secure attachment of engine to vehicle chassis or foundation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with reasoning: The target system element is the 'Baseframe' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a Gas Engine Type 6. The retrieved data contains no exact or even closely similar failure modes, effects, or causes explicitly related to the 'Baseframe' function of facilitating secure attachment of the engine to vehicle chassis or foundation. The existing data primarily relates to other Engine Block components (such as Crankcase, CCV system, Front end housing, Piston cooling jet) with functions mostly about sealing, vibration, support of sensors/cables, or oil and combustion system interfaces. The baseframe function and its associated failure modes—particularly mechanical mounting integrity, structural stability, and load transmission—are structurally different from provided failure data. Thus, a fully creative, multi-perspective generative approach is needed to identify technically accurate failure modes, effects, and causes in line with FMEA standards for the given function and element within this context."
Isolate engine-induced vibrations from external structure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6, engine block subsystem and baseframe element with the function to isolate engine-induced vibrations, while retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 with engine block subsystem but different elements (crankcase, front end housing, CCV system, cylinder liner assembly) and varying but related vibration and structural support functions. Both belong to the same product category (gas engine) and share vibration and structural interface functions related to engine block elements, allowing transfer and adaptation of failure modes and causes focused on induced vibration isolation, structural integrity and bolted joint behavior. Given the baseframe function to isolate vibrations to external structure, failure modes related to excessive vibration transmission, bolted joint loosening, structural fatigue, sensor impacts and assembly/design issues from similar vibration-sensitive engine block components were adapted to the baseframe context. Additional failure modes especially relevant to vibration isolation (loss of isolation function, over-transmission, sticking to resonance frequencies, unintended coupling) were also considered through multi-perspective brainstorming for design, assembly, maintenance and testing aspects."
Transfer thermal loads from engine block to mounting points,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' focusing on the 'Baseframe' element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with the function 'Transfer thermal loads from engine block to mounting points'. The retrieved data contains no information about 'Baseframe' or the transfer of thermal loads from engine block to mounting points, and all retrieved failure modes relate to sealing, oil leakage, or bolted joint failures in the 'Crankcase' or related components within 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Due to this lack of exact or similar functional/system element matches and the different specific function targeted, the context is fundamentally different. Therefore, creative, multi-perspective brainstorming based on engineering knowledge, general FMEA practices for thermal load transfer structures in engine blocks, and baseframe functions is required to generate failure modes, causes and effects according to technical accuracy and FMEA standards."
Provide channels and attachment points for routing auxiliary systems,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Baseframe' having the function 'Provide channels and attachment points for routing auxiliary systems'. The retrieved data refer to 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', components like 'Crankcase', 'Front end housing (damper housing)', and 'CCV (blow-by) system' with functions related to providing installation space and structural support for cable routing, sensors, and piping. The context matches the product category (gas engine), subsystem (engine block), and a similar but not identical component (baseframe vs crankcase/front end housing/CCV). The functions relate closely to supporting and providing routing/attachment points and structural support for auxiliary systems. Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes from these similar contexts are transferable with analytical adaptation to the baseframe element in Gas Engine Type 6. Additional brainstorming was applied to ensure completeness and technical accuracy for the baseframe's role."
Ensure dimensional stability under thermal and mechanical stress,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', element 'Baseframe', function 'Ensure dimensional stability under thermal and mechanical stress'. The retrieved data refers mostly to 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', with components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Crankcase', 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'. Although the exact element 'Baseframe' and its stated function are not present, the overall system context and function — structural integrity and dimensional stability of engine block components under stress — are very similar. Data regarding structural support, vibration effects, bolted joint design, geometry tolerances, and thermal impact on engine block components are strongly relevant to the baseframe's role. Hence, the failure modes, effects, and causes from similar structural components can be adapted and expanded to fit the baseframe function. This adaptation respects the FMEA standards and maintains technical accuracy while addressing the known failure mechanisms relevant to dimensional stability under combined mechanical and thermal stress."
Enable service access to engine block through structural openings,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6 - Engine Block - Baseframe - Enable service access to engine block through structural openings' does not match any retrieved data, which concerns 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Crankcase' or 'CCV system' components and their sealing, leakage, or serviceability functions. The retrieved failure modes relate mainly to sealing, leakage, bolted joint integrity, serviceability of sensor installation, and pressure management, none addressing baseframe structural openings or service access. The baseframe is a structural element enabling physical access, differing fundamentally from sealing and fluid system concerns seen in retrieved data. Hence, there is no exact or similar context match. Therefore, a multi-perspective brainstorming approach is required to generate failure modes, effects, and causes for the baseframe's service access function, leveraging general engineering knowledge of structural design, maintenance access, and mechanical integrity within engine blocks in gas engines."
Insulates the gas from heat of the crankcase (20),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'V-room insulation' performing the function 'Insulates the gas from heat of the crankcase (20)'. The retrieved data corresponds to the Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, and identical functional description. Despite being a different product version (Type 4 vs Type 6), the subsystem and component function are strictly the same, belonging to the same product category of gas engines. Therefore, the failure modes, effects, and causes are transferable with analytical verification. Given no exact match due to product version difference, the SIMILAR_CONTEXT approach allows using retrieved failure data, adapted and verified to the Type 6 context. The failure modes predominantly relate to 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' resulting in combustion-related issues, induced by V-room design, material selection, manufacturing tolerances, transient operation, and combustion system characteristics. These cause critical effects like engine knocking and combustion instability. These failure patterns and causes apply similarly for the Gas Engine Type 6’s V-room insulation, given the similar thermal insulation function and operating principles. Hence, failure modes and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 can be adapted without new modes outside the retrieved data scope."
Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, V-room insulation, function Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase) matches exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, and function. Both product and subsystem are closely aligned product family (Gas Engine types) with identical system element and identical function. Therefore, only failure modes, effects, and causes from the retrieved data are used without generating new ones, maintaining technical precision and FMEA standards."
Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6, while retrieved data is for Gas Engine Type 4, same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), and identical function ('Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head'). Slight difference in product type but highly similar functional and structural context, permitting transfer and technical adaptation of failure modes, effects and causes from Type 4 to Type 6 without introducing new failure modes beyond retrieved data. All failure modes, effects and causes remain valid for the target context with minor analytical confirmation."
Sealing to lower crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved context matches the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), and function (Sealing to lower crankcase), but is from Gas Engine Type 4 instead of Gas Engine Type 6. Given high similarity of product family and identical functional context, failure modes, causes, and effects from Type 4 context are applicable and can be analytically adapted without inventing new failure modes or causes. The leakage-related failure modes and associated failure causes (design, material, assembly, operating conditions) are typical for sealing functions in engine blocks and remain valid for Type 6. No new failure modes are introduced per EXACT_MATCH rule, but adapted for the new product context."
Sealing to upper crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), and identical function (Sealing to upper crankcase) but different product version (Type 4 vs Type 6). The system element and function match exactly within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem, allowing transfer and adaptation of failure modes, causes, and effects with analytical verification. Given the similarity, the failure modes, effects, and causes are directly applicable with no fundamental mismatch, while acknowledging potential implementation differences due to product version."
Direct blow-by gas from crankcase to gas mixer,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element CCV (blow-by) system with function 'Direct blow-by gas from crankcase to gas mixer'. The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, and closely matching function descriptions (e.g., 'Directs blow-by gas from crankcase to gas mixer'). Product category and functional context are consistent, allowing transfer and adaptation of failure modes, effects, and causes. Minor contextual adjustments are applied to maintain relevance for the specific engine type 6 environment."
Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, CCV (blow-by) system, function: Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system) matches exactly in subsystem, system element, and function with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. Both are gas engines with identical subsystem and function context, so failure modes, effects, and causes are transferable with minor adaptation if needed. Considering the close product category and functional similarity, the retrieved failure data perfectly applies to the target system. No new failure modes are generated beyond those retrieved, only analytical adaptation to the target product implied. This complies with context analysis rules for SIMILAR_CONTEXT."
Direct oil back to the crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, 'Engine Block' subsystem, focusing on the CCV (blow-by) system with the function 'Direct oil back to the crankcase'. Retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, same product category (gas engine) and subsystem, same system element (CCV/blow-by system) with similar function. This is a directly analogous context with minor product generation difference and thus suitable for transfer and analytical adaptation. The failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 CCV (blow-by) system can be applied to Type 6, considering design evolution but fundamentally the same function and failure risks exist. Additional brainstorming was applied to ensure comprehensive coverage of failure modes related to oil return function within the CCV blow-by system in an engine block context."
Provide structural support for filters and separators,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data includes failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes explicitly related to the 'CCV (blow-by) system' element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a Gas Engine (Type 4). This matches the target system context of Gas Engine Type 6, which belongs to the same product category (gas engine) and subsystem (engine block) with the exact system element (CCV blow-by system) and the same function of providing structural support for filters and separators. Although the engine type version differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), the product category, subsystem, element, and function match directly, thus according to the decision matrix, only the failure modes, effects, and causes found in the retrieved data applicable to the exact context should be used without creation of new failure modes or causes. The target function 'Provide structural support for filters and separators' corresponds exactly to the failure mode 'Structural support fails' and related failure causes and effects in the retrieved data. Therefore, a direct adaptation and use of this relevant failure mode and associated causes and effects from the retrieved documents is the correct approach."
Distribute blow-by gas to filter system,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved failure modes, effects, and causes precisely describe the CCV (blow-by) system component of the Engine Block subsystem within a gas engine (Gas Engine Type 4), matching exactly the product category, subsystem, system element, and the function of distributing blow-by gas to the filter system as required for Gas Engine Type 6. The functional context and detailed failure data (failure modes, effects, causes, preventive and detective measures) presented are specific and technically accurate for the CCV system addressing distribution of blow-by gas, and no significant contextual differences exist between Gas Engine Type 4 and Type 6 for this subsystem and function. Therefore, these failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes can be directly applied without generation of new failure data outside what is retrieved."
Prevent condensation to oil,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), and identical function (Prevent condensation to oil) as the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4. Both are gas engines with similar CCV system design and function in the same subsystem context. Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes are transferable with analytical adaptation to the Type 6 engine but no fundamental change required."
Allow replacements of filters and separators,"EXACT_MATCH - The retrieved context data corresponds exactly to the target system in terms of Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), and Function (Allow replacements of filters and separators). The product naming difference (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6) is considered a minor version difference within the same product category and subsystem with the same system element and function. Therefore, only the failure modes, causes, and effects found in the retrieved dataset are used without generating new failure data."
Provide installation space for sensors,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' having the function 'Provide installation space for sensors'. Retrieved data mostly refers to 'Gas Engine Type 4' but matches exactly the subsystem, system element, and function. According to the context analysis decision matrix, this is a SIMILAR_CONTEXT case because the same function and system element appear in a different engine type (Product variation). Therefore, applicable failure modes, failure effects, and causes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' can be transferred and adapted to 'Gas Engine Type 6' CCV system, considering the functional and environmental similarities. Additional brainstorming is not required as the retrieved data already covers relevant and technical failure modes with causes and effects for this function. The main failure modes are 'Poor serviceability', 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification', and 'Replacement not possible', which correspond well to the CCV system providing installation space for sensors. Causes and effects focus on design, assembly, vibration, maintenance, and structural aspects. These are valid for the updated system context."
Provide installation space for cable routing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT – The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, CCV (blow-by) system, function: Provide installation space for cable routing) is functionally and element-wise matching to related data from Gas Engine Type 4’s CCV (blow-by) system within the Engine Block subsystem that includes the identical function of providing installation space for cable routing. Both are gas engine engine blocks with a CCV system performing a similar supporting and routing role for cables. Therefore, applicable failure modes, effects, and causes from Gas Engine Type 4 can be transferred and adapted to Type 6. The data is relevant and consistent with the given function, focusing on mechanical, design and assembly issues that affect installation space usability and reliability for cable routing. Minor contextual shifts may apply due to potential engine version changes, but no fundamentally new failure modes are warranted beyond the retrieved information."
Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation,"EXACT_MATCH according to the Context Analysis Decision Matrix because the retrieved data matches exactly in: Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), and Function (Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation). The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' can be considered a direct successor or variant within the same product family to 'Gas Engine Type 4', hence failure modes, causes, and effects are applicable without modification or creative addition. Therefore, only failure modes, effects, and causes found in the retrieved data exactly are used, following strict FMEA standards and technical accuracy."
Isolate engine vibrations from the engine block structure,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Vibration isolation', function 'Isolate engine vibrations from the engine block structure'. The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', mostly focusing on components related to vibration effects within the engine block and related subsystems, but no explicit or direct data for 'Vibration isolation' as a system element nor for exactly the function to isolate engine vibrations from the engine block structure. The data primarily describes vibration modes ('Vibration is too high', 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification') for related structural components (Front end housing, crankcase, CCV system) and their effects, causes, and mitigation steps, but not isolation elements themselves. According to the CONTEXT ANALYSIS DECISION MATRIX, this is a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT case as there is fundamentally no exact or similar function-system element match for 'Vibration isolation' in the engine block. Thus, a creative and technically grounded brainstorming approach is required, leveraging knowledge of vibration isolation in engine blocks, related failure modes, effects, and causes identified in the retrieved documents with adaptation and extension for the specific element 'Vibration isolation'."
Absorb mechanical vibrations transmitted from the engine block,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block' and the system element 'Vibration isolation' whose function is to absorb mechanical vibrations transmitted from the engine block. The retrieved data contains failure modes related to vibration issues in the 'Engine Block' subsystem but primarily from a 'Gas Engine Type 4' system and components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Crankcase', and 'CCV (blow-by) system'. The system element 'Vibration isolation' is functionally related to the components described, as these also deal with vibration transmission and attenuation within the engine block. Although the exact element name differs, the vibration isolation function aligns with the vibration-related failure modes documented. Hence, this is a SIMILAR_CONTEXT situation involving the same product category (gas engine), subsystem (engine block), and vibration-related functions, but for a different engine type and slightly different elements. It is appropriate to adapt failure modes, effects, and causes related to 'vibration is too high' and vibration isolation/attenuation issues to generate a technically accurate FMEA for the target system."
Reduce transmission of vibrational energy to adjacent components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT based on the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), and closely related System Elements (Vibration isolation in Gas Engine Type 6 vs Front end housing (damper housing), Crankcase related vibration issues in Gas Engine Type 4). Despite different specific system elements and slight model or generation differences (Type 6 vs Type 4), the vibration isolation function and its failure impacts are fundamentally comparable. Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes related to excessive vibration transmission, structural support relating to vibration, and vibration-induced failures from the retrieved data are applicable and have been analytically adapted to the Vibration isolation element in the Engine Block of the Gas Engine Type 6. Additional failure modes reflecting loss of vibration isolation function and over-vibration transmission are included with causes and effects consistent with the technical domain and validated failure cause categories (assembly, bolted joint, design, and operating conditions)."
Prevent fatigue damage caused by engine vibrations,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation' function 'Prevent fatigue damage caused by engine vibrations'. The retrieved data mainly covers Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, with vibration-related failure modes mainly in components like Front end housing (damper housing), Crankcase, V-room insulation, and CCV (blow-by) system. Although the exact system element 'Vibration isolation' is not directly present in the retrieved data, the failure mode 'Vibration is too high' from structurally and functionally related engine block components corresponds to the vibration control context and fatigue damage risk, hence highly relevant. Therefore, failure modes, effects, and causes related to vibration control in the engine block are transferable and can be adapted analytically to 'Vibration isolation' function for Type 6 engines with respect to fatigue damage prevention. Considering product similarity (gas engine), subsystem similarity (engine block), and function similarity (vibration control/fatigue prevention), the SIMILAR_CONTEXT approach applies. This also allows the generation of additional relevant failure modes like loss of isolation function and functional limitation. All failure causes (design, assembly, transient operation) related to vibration are relevant and applicable to the vibration isolation element function."
Maintain structural integrity under dynamic vibration loads,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data pertains to Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, components related to vibration isolation and structural support (e.g. Front end housing, Crankcase, Rear end cover) with functions closely aligned to maintaining structural integrity under dynamic vibration loads. Although the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 (different engine generation/version), the product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block) and system element function (vibration isolation for structural integrity) closely match the target context. Therefore, existing failure modes, causes, and effects can be transferred and adapted with consideration for engine type differences, ensuring relevance and technical accuracy. No exact data was found specifically named as 'Vibration isolation' in Gas Engine Type 6, so this represents a similar context case and multi-perspective analytical adaptation is applied."
Dampen transient vibration events during engine start-up and shut-down,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Vibration isolation', with the function to 'Dampen transient vibration events during engine start-up and shut-down'. Retrieved data includes failure modes, causes, and effects related to vibration and vibration-related issues in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', specifically concerning vibration in damper housing and crankcase components that are structurally very close or functionally relevant to the vibration isolation element. The function of vibration dampening is similar though not exact (they address vibration magnitude control and isolation), so the data can be analytically adapted. The vibration too high failure mode covering the vibration isolation/damping function is applicable with careful adaptation. Additional brainstorming on possible failure modes specifically of a 'vibration isolation' element (e.g. loss of damping, over-damping, stiffness changes) was done to ensure completeness and relevance in gas engine vibration isolation at transient conditions."
Provide compliant support to engine block while restricting excessive motion,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' focusing on the 'Engine Block' subsystem with the system element 'Vibration isolation' tasked to 'Provide compliant support to engine block while restricting excessive motion'. The retrieved data provides no exact matching failure modes related specifically to 'Vibration isolation' in the engine block, and no failure modes are linked directly to compliant vibration support elements in the gas engine context. Existing data primarily relates to structural engine block components (e.g., front end housing), piston motion, sealing, and gas flow, but not to vibration isolation elements. Thus, this represents a different context from the retrieved failures, which are mostly structural support or component interaction based, rather than compliant isolation systems preventing excessive motion. Therefore, a multi-perspective brainstorming approach is applied leveraging engineering knowledge of vibration isolation in engine blocks, considering design, development, testing, and after-sales perspectives while adapting known causes and effects from structural vibration failures and applying general vibration isolation failure knowledge to this new system element function and context."
Prevent loosening of bolted joints through vibration mitigation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, element Vibration isolation, with the function to prevent loosening of bolted joints through vibration mitigation. The retrieved data contains failure modes mostly related to sealing, oil leakage, and vibration effects focused on other components like V-room insulation and Crankcase in Gas Engine Type 4. Specifically, no exact or close match was found for ‘Vibration isolation’ as a system element with the function of preventing bolted joint loosening via vibration mitigation in the same or even similar Gas Engine Type 6 context. The available data addresses vibration effects indirectly linked to loosening but not the failure modes and causes particular to vibration isolation systems in Engine Block from a bolted joint loosening perspective. Due to this lack of exact or sufficiently similar context, and the different specificity of the vibration isolation element and its function, a DIFFERENT CONTEXT generation is appropriate. Multi-perspective brainstorming is applied, leveraging the fundamental functionality and potential failure types of vibration isolation systems in engine blocks, their design, assembly, operational and environmental influences, as well as testing and maintenance consequences. The failure modes, effects and causes formulated are technically accurate, consistent with FMEA standards, and customized for the target function of vibration isolation preventing bolted joint loosening in gas engine blocks."
Control vibration frequency and amplitude within specified limits,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, element Vibration Isolation with the function to control vibration frequency and amplitude within specified limits. The retrieved data is primarily from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, components (Front end housing/damper housing, Crankcase, V-room insulation, CCV system) related to managing vibration and structural responses. Although the exact element 'Vibration isolation' is not presented, the functional context of controlling vibration and its influence on structural and sensor related components is well matched in similar elements managing vibration and damping within the engine block. Hence, failure modes derived for related engine block components controlling vibration are relevant and transferable with analytical adaptation for vibration isolation function. The failure modes 'Vibration is too high', 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification', and related structural support failures are applicable from the retrieved data, with adjusted focus on vibration isolation rather than housing or crankcase structure. Additional failure modes such as loss of vibration control function, functional limitation, or unintended vibration amplification are elaborated based on multi-perspective brainstorming, aligned to vibration isolation principles."
Interface vibration dampers with mounting points to minimize noise transmission,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation' function 'Interface vibration dampers with mounting points to minimize noise transmission' closely relates to the retrieved failure data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' under the same subsystem and similar system elements like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and components involving vibration management and interfacing vibration dampers. Although the exact element 'Vibration isolation' is not specifically named, vibration-related failure modes in mounting interfaces and housings that serve vibration damping/isolation functions are analogous and applicable. Hence, failure modes related to excessive vibration, structural support, and interface stability are transferable with careful adaptation. New failure modes directly related to 'vibration isolation' (e.g., functional interruption by damper failure) are analytically generated based on multi-perspective engineering reasoning but grounded on retrieved patterns and context relevance."
