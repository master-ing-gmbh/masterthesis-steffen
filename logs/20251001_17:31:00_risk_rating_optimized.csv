Assembly process deficiencies including misalignment and improper bolted joint implementation,"Oil leakage to external environment, leading to potential oil loss and environmental contamination","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Leakage to crankcase exterior' of the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem closely matches a failure mode 'Leakage crankcase (outside)' in the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. Both share the same product category ('Gas Engine'), same system element (PCJ), subsystem (Engine Block), function (Sealing of main oil gallery), and failure effect (oil leakage to environment), with very similar failure causes focusing on assembly process deficiencies including misalignment and bolted joint issues. Preventive measures (Design for assembly, Assembly instruction, O-Ring & TA Tightening specifications) and detective measures (Assembly trial, MCE Functional Testing with daily leakage inspection) are nearly identical in both contexts. The difference in engine model (Type 4 vs Type 6) implies slightly evolved design and possibly marginally tighter controls or updated procedures, but no fundamental change in failure mechanism or detection/preventive effectiveness is indicated. Retrieved data shows occurrence rating of 2 and detection rating of 1-4 depending on cause/detection method in a very similar context, and a severity rating of 9 for oil leakage to environment effects (negligible direct regulatory violation but serious environmental impact and customer dissatisfaction). Given the strong match and slight possible nuances, ratings are adapted minimally from the exact previous context for current preventive/detective measures, confirming their applicability and effectiveness. Severity is kept at 9 due to environmental contamination and oil loss consequences, occurrence is assigned as 2 due to effective preventive measures reducing assembly failures to unlikely, and detection is assigned as 2 indicating near-certain detection during assembly trial and daily inspection of leakage before customer delivery. Thus, SIMILAR_CONTEXT ratings apply with minor adjustment reflecting updated system but overall consistent risk profile and measures effectiveness."
Aging and degradation of O-Ring seals combined with bolted joint fatigue and possible corrosion,Progressive oil leakage to environment causing reduced lubrication efficiency and increased maintenance,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar failure mode 'Leakage crankcase (outside) over time' for the same component 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category). Although the target is Gas Engine Type 6, the close similarity in system element, subsystem, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect in the same product category and functional context allows direct usage of retrieved risk ratings. Preventive and detective measures are closely aligned with those in the retrieved data, confirming applicability of ratings without adjustment."
"O-Ring aging, gasket sealant aging, corrosion due to engine room humidity, incorrect maintenance planning, and bolted joint design flaws","Oil leaks causing contamination of coolant or loss of oil pressure, potentially leading to engine overheating or failure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with piston cooling jet (PCJ) in the engine block sealing the main oil gallery. The retrieved data strongly relates to similar failure modes ('Degradation of sealing over time') in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the engine block subsystem, affecting sealing functions with causes including O-Ring aging, gasket sealant aging, corrosion, bolted joint design flaws, and maintenance planning. Preventive and detective measures are also very similar. Although the exact system element (PCJ) and product generation (Type 6 vs Type 4) differ, the core functional context and failure mode/failure cause/failure effect match closely, qualifying for a SIMILAR_CONTEXT decision. 

Severity ratings from the retrieved data on similar sealing degradation failures range between 5 (for coolant in oil, oil contamination) and 7 (for oil leaks causing pressure loss, environmental contamination, engine overheating or failure). Since the oil leaks causing contamination/loss of pressure potentially lead to engine overheating or failure (which directly impacts engine function and customer dissatisfaction), a severity rating of 7 is justified and consistent with those in the retrieved data. 

Occurrence ratings for failure causes such as O-Ring aging, gasket aging, corrosion, bolted joint design flaws, and maintenance planning are typically 2-3 in the retrieved data, reflecting low to unlikely occurrence due to strong preventive measures like supplier involvement, design verification, coatings, FEA simulations, and maintenance planning. Maintaining these ratings (around 3) is reasonable given the similarly robust preventive approach in the target system. 

Detection ratings vary depending on the failure cause: 
- Causes with good testing coverage (leakage tests, endurance runs, preload/vibration measurement) have detection ratings of 3-4 (high likelihood of detection before failure). 
- Maintenance planning issues have detection ratings around 7 (no detection before customer see impact, field validation only). 

Considering these, the summarized detection rating aligned with multiple failure causes and the given detective measures is around 4 (high likelihood of detection through active leakage and endurance testing combined with assembly and preload measurements). This balances the harder-to-detect maintenance planning cause rated worse (7) but is offset by multiple more detectable causes.

Therefore, adapted ratings consistent with the documented context, considering the more advanced engine type but similar sealing complexity and measures, are:
- Severity: 7
- Occurrence: 3
- Detection: 4

This approach aligns with the retrieved data in a similar product category, subsystem, function, failure mode, causes, effects, and existing controls, suitably adapted to the target system context."
"Improper bolted joint design, misalignment during assembly, incorrect geometry tolerances, and non-compliant machining",Crankcase oil gallery sealing failure resulting in pressure loss and possible engine shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient sealing due to design or assembly errors' for the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely aligns with failure modes related to sealing and bolted joint design in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', specifically failure modes like 'Leakage of oil inside crankcase' and 'Leakage crankcase (outside)'. Both deal with sealing failures causing pressure loss and potential engine shutdown. Differences in engine type (6 vs 4) imply potentially similar technical complexity and customer impact but may have slightly different operational environments or tolerances requiring moderate rating adaptation. Preventive and detective measures listed for the target system are extensive and comparable to those in retrieved similar contexts, with design calculation, FEA simulation, sonic bolt measurement, validation, and functional testing applied. Given the severity of oil gallery pressure loss and possible engine shutdown, a severity rating aligned with prior similar sealing failures is appropriate but recognizing the critical function, the severity is set moderately high (7). Occurrence rating should reflect strong preventive measures such as VDI 2230 calculations, FEA, ultrasonic checks, RAIP, and assembly instructions which reduce frequency; existing data for bolted joint design related leakage shows occurrence ratings of 3-5, here taking the robust preventive measures in target system, occurrence is rated conservatively as 3 (low likelihood). Detection measures combine functional tests, assembly trials, ultrasonic measurements, and field validation, which are effective; retrieval shows detection ratings of 4-5 for similar causes; considering strong validation plan and measurements, detection rating at 4 (high likelihood of detection before customer) is appropriate. Hence, adapting retrieved ratings with analytical adjustment results in Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 consistent with product category, system element and failure cause similarity."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Main bearing failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved graph query data for Gas Engine Type 4 and target failure mode in the same subsystem, system element, function, failure cause, failure effect, and very similar preventive and detective measures. The target is Gas Engine Type 6 (close model variant, same product category and highly similar functional context). Preventive and detective measures in target and retrieved data are consistent. Customer impact (main bearing failure) is rated severity 8 as per definition 'Reduced service, customers dissatisfied' for such failure effects. Preventive measures covering design for assembly and assembly instruction result in a low occurrence rating of 2 ('Unlikely'). Detective measure 'Assembly trial' assures almost certain detection (detection rating 1). No substantive differences exist to justify adaptation under SIMILAR_CONTEXT; therefore, the retrieved ratings are valid for direct use."
Carbon deposit from oil,Main bearing failure,"EXACT_MATCH - The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 matches exactly with the target context in terms of Product Category (Gas Engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet), Function (Opens at a desired opening pressure), Failure Mode (Not opening at the desired pressure), Failure Cause (Carbon deposit from oil), and Failure Effect (Main bearing failure). The preventive measures ('TA Oil management', 'Cleanliness standards') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)', 'Field validation (Component inspection)') also match perfectly. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be used directly without adaptation. Severity rating of 8 correctly reflects a significant customer impact due to main bearing failure (reduced service and dissatisfaction, possible significant damage). Occurrence rating of 4 indicates occasional occurrence considering effective preventive measures, which aligns with the measures listed. Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection only through targeted inspections (functional/component inspection), suiting the detective methods described. Hence, retrieved ratings are consistent and appropriate for the target system context."
Check-Valve design,Main bearing failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an EXACT MATCH for almost all elements except the product variant (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6). Both are in the same product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Opens at desired opening pressure), failure mode (Not opening at desired pressure), failure cause (Check-Valve design) and failure effect (Main bearing failure) with identical preventive and detective measures. Given the strong similarity with only a product version difference, the retrieved risk ratings are highly applicable. The operating principles and criticality for main bearing failure due to PCJ failure in Gas Engines of similar type are consistent between variants. Therefore, the severity rating remains at 8 (reduced service, customers dissatisfied due to main bearing failure which is severe mechanical damage), occurrence at 4 (occasional occurrence considering existing 1D oil circuit analysis), and detection at 4 (high likelihood of detection via existing Component test rig and MCE Functional testing including oil pressure monitoring and piston thermal survey). No strong reason exists to adjust these ratings significantly for Type 6 from Type 4, since failure effects, causes, and controls are effectively the same and detection/ preventive measures are identical."
Check-Valve wear,Main bearing failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), function 'Opens at a desired opening pressure', failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure', failure cause 'Check-Valve wear', failure effect 'Main bearing failure') corresponds exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and matching preventive and detective measures. Although the product is a different version (Type 6 vs. Type 4), both belong to the same product category (gas engines), and the functional and failure context is identical, the operating environment and design details are expected similar enough to use the same ratings directly. Preventive and detective measures are also identical, supporting the use of the retrieved ratings without adjustment."
Cleanliness,Main bearing failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match in subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Piston cooling jet (PCJ)'), function ('Opens at a desired opening pressure'), failure mode ('Not opening at the desired pressure'), failure cause ('Cleanliness'), and failure effect ('Main bearing failure') but from product 'Gas Engine Type 4' vs target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The product category (gas engines) and functional context remain consistent; therefore, it is a similar context case. The preventive and detective measures are identical, indicating comparable effectiveness in managing the failure cause. Severity is consistent at 8, reflecting a high impact due to main bearing failure causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction. Occurrence is rated as 2 (unlikely) considering established cleanliness standards and oil management effectively reduce the failure cause likelihood. Detection is rated 5, meaning detection occurs through targeted inspections such as MCE Functional Testing and Field validation, appropriate since these measures are already implemented. No adjustments needed in severity and detection; occurrence rating is justified due to effective preventive controls. Hence, recommended ratings align closely with retrieved data for similar context with strong rationale support."
Geometry tolerances,Main bearing failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match of the failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure' caused by 'Geometry tolerances' on the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, but for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Both products belong to the same Gas Engine product category and share very similar functional context. Preventive measures (FPQ, Component test rig) and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing) are identical between retrieved and target contexts. Therefore, it qualifies as SIMILAR_CONTEXT with very close similarity. 

Severity: The failure effect 'Main bearing failure' is critical, leading to very dissatisfied customers and potential machine damage. The retrieved severity rating is 8, consistent with the impact definition for such severe mechanical damage. No reason to deviate; thus severity retained as 8.

Occurrence: The occurrence rating in the retrieved data is 3 (Low likelihood), reflecting effective preventive measures ('FPQ', 'Component test rig') controlling geometry tolerance causes. Given no new preventive measures nor changes suggesting increased risk for the target system, occurrence rating remains 3.

Detection: The detection rating in retrieved data is 4 (High likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) due to the 'MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)' measure. The target system has the same detective measure, expected detection capability same. Detection rating kept at 4.

Hence, ratings are well-aligned with the context and measures, no adjustment needed beyond acknowledging slight product generation difference which doesn’t materially impact risk parameters."
Not machined to spec,Main bearing failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data presents a failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure' caused by 'Not machined to spec' in the same system element (Piston cooling jet), function, failure mode, and failure effect ('Main bearing failure') but in Gas Engine Type 4 instead of Gas Engine Type 6. Both belong to the same product category (gas engine) and subsystem (Engine Block) with identical preventive and detective measures. The failure effect severity is rated as 8 consistently, indicating a severe impact. Preventive measures FPQ and Drawing specification effectively reduce occurrence to 3 (low likelihood). The detective measure 'MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)' allows high likelihood detection rated as 4. Given the similarity in product and system context but a newer engine type, slight environmental or operational differences might marginally impact detection or occurrence, but the existing data's ratings remain appropriate and conservative. Therefore, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly transferable here with no adjustment needed."
Nozzle holder,Main bearing failure,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block' and the specific element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' for the failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure' caused by the 'Nozzle holder', resulting in 'Main bearing failure'. The retrieved data provides an EXACT MATCH from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, with highly overlapping preventive and detective measures that are almost identical to the target. The severity rating of 8 sufficiently reflects a severe customer impact due to main bearing failure (major functional failure, possibly leading to downtime and dissatisfaction). The occurrence rating of 4 aligns with the fact that preventive measures are in place but occasional occurrences still happen (preventive measures like O-Ring specs, tightening specs, oil circuit analysis, and tolerance checks are comprehensive but do not entirely eliminate failure). The detection rating of 4 indicates a high likelihood of detection during functional or component testing before delivery, consistent with the existing extensive MCE functional testing and component test rigs. Given the near-identical context, measures, and failure characteristics, the original ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Vibration,Main bearing failure,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context matches exactly to the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function ('Opens at a desired opening pressure'), failure mode ('Not opening at the desired pressure'), failure cause ('Vibration'), and failure effect ('Main bearing failure'). The preventive measure ('FEA Modal Analysis') and detective measure ('Hammer/Modal test') also match exactly. Thus, extracted ratings are directly applicable to the target context of 'Gas Engine Type 6' as both are gas engine types in the same product category with consistent functional and failure contexts. Severity is confirmed high (8) due to serious impact (main bearing failure), Occurrence moderate (4) due to occasional likelihood with current preventive measure, and Detection moderate-high (4) due to reasonable detection capability with modal testing. No adjustments are necessary."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Opens at desired opening pressure), failure mode (Closes not at the desired pressure), failure cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)), and failure effect (Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston), with identical preventive and detective measures. Ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 context are fully applicable to Gas Engine Type 6 since product category and operating environment are comparable and preventive/detective measures match exactly, allowing direct reuse of ratings."
Carbon deposit from oil,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the Piston cooling jet (PCJ) with the failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure', caused by 'Carbon deposit from oil', resulting in the failure effect 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston' matches the requested context except for the product version (Type 4 vs Type 6). The subsystem (Engine Block), system element (PCJ), function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and existing preventive and detective measures align exactly. Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines), and the functional context and preventive/detective measures are identical. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are fully applicable. No significant changes in operation or customer impact are expected between engine types 4 and 6 regarding this failure. Preventive measures ('TA Oil management', 'Cleanliness standards') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)', 'Field validation (Component inspection)') are consistent with those in the retrieved data. Hence, risk ratings can be used directly without adjustment."
Check-Valve design,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and retrieved data 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), Failure Mode ('Closes not at the desired pressure'), Failure Cause ('Check-Valve design'), and Failure Effect ('Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston'). The preventive measure ('1d oil circuit analysis (PCJ)') and detective measures ('Component test rig', 'MCE Functional Testing (Oil pressure monitoring and piston thermal survey)') are identical as well. Given these strong overlaps and similarity in function and context, it is appropriate to adapt the retrieved ratings with high confidence. 

Severity rating is consistent at 6 due to process disturbance causing problems for some customers (oil flow fluctuation impacting piston cooling but not immediately causing engine failure). 

Occurrence rating of 4 indicates occasional occurrence considering the existing preventive measure effectiveness (1d oil circuit analysis). The check-valve design issue is not eliminated but controlled. 

Detection rating of 4 matches a high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes using test rig and functional testing.

No significant context changes necessitate rating adjustments since both engine types are similar product family with comparable operational and testing regimes."
Check-Valve wear,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' due to 'Check-Valve wear' in the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved data provides an exact match for all aspects except the product is 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of 'Type 6', which is the same product category and subsystem. The failure mode, cause, effect, preventive and detective measures are identical or semantically equivalent, allowing for direct use of ratings with consideration for any differences in newer engine type (Type 6) potentially having improved design or measures. However, since preventive and detective measures listed are the same and no evidence suggests major changes affecting failure likelihood or detection, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable. Severity is 6 because fluctuation of the oil flow affects piston cooling causing process disturbance but not regulatory or catastrophic failure. Occurrence is 4 indicating occasional occurrence with FPQ preventive measure in place. Detection is 5 reflecting detection mainly via targeted inspections and field validations, consistent with described measures. Given the strong contextual similarity and identical failure scenario, no significant adjustment is needed, and the retrieved ratings can be applied confidently."
Cleanliness,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, while the target system is Gas Engine Type 6, both within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) utilizing the same System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)) with the exact Failure Mode ('Closes not at the desired pressure'), Failure Cause ('Cleanliness'), and Failure Effect ('Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston'). This constitutes a similar context according to the matrix, since only product variant differs. Preventive and detective measures are identical indicating comparable risk controls. Severity of 6 is appropriate due to process disturbance with customer impact. Occurrence rating of 2 aligns with effective preventive cleanliness measures and TA Oil management, implying failure cause is unlikely but possible. Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection only by targeted inspections (MCE Functional Testing and Field validation), consistent with current measures. Given the above, no adjustment is needed for severity or detection. Occurrence remains low likelihood due to cleanliness standards and oil management, consistent with the retrieved rating. This yields reliable and representative risk ratings for the target Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Geometry tolerances,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4 system for the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' subsystem with failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure', failure cause 'Geometry tolerances', and failure effect 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston' exactly matches the target context in terms of product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet), function (close at desired pressure), failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and preventive and detective measures. Although the target product is Type 6 and retrieved data is from Type 4, both belong to the same product category with highly similar functional contexts and preventive/detective measures (FPQ, component test rig and MCE functional testing). Hence, the existing severity (6), occurrence (3), and detection (4) ratings are directly applicable without modification. These ratings logically reflect a moderate severity (process disturbance, effect on some customers), a low occurrence due to effective preventive measures on geometry tolerances, and a high likelihood of detection by functional testing before customer delivery."
Not machined to spec,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, and the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, both in the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) with the same system element (Piston cooling jet PCJ), identical failure mode ('Closes not at the desired pressure'), failure cause ('Not machined to spec'), and failure effect ('Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston'). Preventive and detective measures match closely ('FPQ', 'Drawing specification' preventive; 'MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)' detective). Given this near-exact match except for engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4), which likely have very similar design and operating environments, the retrieved risk ratings are highly applicable. The severity rating remains 6 since the failure effect impacts oil flow fluctuation, causing process disturbance/problem for some customers without regulation or severe financial damage. Occurrence remains at 3 reflecting low likelihood due to effective preventive controls. Detection remains 4 due to high likelihood of detection via MCE functional testing before delivery. Minor adaptation unnecessary as preventive/detective measures and failure effects are equivalent in both contexts."
Nozzle holder,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' on the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' due to 'Nozzle holder' causing 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston' matches exactly with retrieved FMEA data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' on the same subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar with matching items including 'O-Ring specification', 'TA Tightening specification', '1d oil circuit analysis (PCJ)', 'Tolerance stack-up', '3D Modal clash check', and detective testing methods like 'Component test rig' and multiple 'MCE Functional Testing' measures. Considering these strong equivalences and consistent measures, the retrieved ratings can be directly applied without adjustment."
Vibration,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' due to 'Vibration' in the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in the Gas Engine Type 6 is highly similar to the exact retrieved context of Gas Engine Type 4 with same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause and effect. Preventive measures (FEA Modal Analysis etc.) and detective measures (Hammer/Modal test) listed for Gas Engine Type 6 are also closely aligned with those used in Gas Engine Type 4. Therefore, the existing risk ratings for Severity (6), Occurrence (4), and Detection (4) from Gas Engine Type 4 directly apply. Severity is rated 6 due to process disturbance and problems for some customers (fluctuation of oil flow rate). Occurrence is 4 as preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate likelihood. Detection is 4 as there is a high likelihood of detection in subsequent test processes. No significant operational or customer impact differences justify adjustments, thus ratings are reused as is."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, same 'Engine Block' subsystem, identical system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', same function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect with exactly matching preventive and detective measures. Only difference is engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product category (Gas Engines), which is allowed as minor product variant within identical context. Severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are consistent with failure effect 'Piston seizure' and current preventive (Design for assembly Poke Yoke, assembly instruction) and detective (assembly trial) measures. Severity rating 7 indicates significant customer dissatisfaction due to piston seizure causing reduced service or damage but not regulatory or catastrophic financial violation. Occurrence rating 2 is justified by effective preventive measures reducing likelihood to unlikely. Detection rating 1 reflects very high probability of certain detection during assembly trial, aligned with described measures. Thus, ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Carbon deposit from oil,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), identical system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function, failure mode 'Too little oil', failure cause 'Carbon deposit from oil', and failure effect 'Piston seizure', but from a slightly different product generation (Type 4 vs Type 6). The preventive and detective measures are identical. Therefore, ratings can be directly adapted with minor context considerations. Given that product evolution from Type 4 to Type 6 is likely incremental and does not fundamentally alter the failure mechanism or impact, severity remains consistent. Preventive measures ('TA Oil management', 'Cleanliness standards') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)', 'Field validation (Component inspection)') are unchanged and provide similar detection capability and cause containment. The severity rating of 7 corresponds to reduced service / customer dissatisfaction due to piston seizure (still consistent). Occurrence rating of 4 reflects occasional occurrence despite preventive controls (carbon deposits are known, controlled but not eliminated). Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection relying on targeted inspections (functional and field validations), not guaranteed at early stages. Hence, using the retrieved ratings unchanged is justified and recommended to maintain consistency and accuracy."
Check-Valve design,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Piston cooling jet PCJ, failure mode 'Too little oil', failure cause 'Check-Valve design', failure effect 'Piston seizure') closely matches an existing failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, component, function, failure mode, cause, and effect. Given the same product category and functional context, this is a highly similar but not exact product variant. The preventive and detective measures are the same, indicating similar effectiveness. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings for Severity (7), Occurrence (4), and Detection (4), from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable without adjustment. Severity is rated 7 due to the serious operational impact causing piston seizure but not regulatory violation or catastrophic financial loss. Occurrence rating 4 reflects occasional occurrence despite existing 1D oil circuit analysis preventive measure. Detection rating 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection through component test rig and MCE functional testing before customer delivery."
"Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data contains an exact match for the target system context. Both the target and retrieved data share the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), Function (Directs oil to piston gallery), Failure Mode (Too little oil), Failure Cause (Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)), and Failure Effect (Piston seizure). The preventive measures (Design for maintenance (Poke Yoke etc.), Service instruction) and detective measure (Field validation (Fracas)) also exactly match. Therefore, the existing Severity, Occurrence, and Detection (S=7, O=2, D=5) ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 can be applied without adjustments. This is consistent with the definitions: Severity 7 aligns with 'reduced service, customers dissatisfied' due to piston seizure risk; Occurrence 2 reflects the effectiveness of preventive maintenance design; Detection 5 corresponds to detection only through targeted inspection (field validation)."
Nozzle holder,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH found with Gas Engine Type 4 for Piston cooling jet (PCJ), failure mode 'Too little oil', failure cause 'Nozzle holder', and failure effect 'Piston seizure'. The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data exactly match or are effectively equivalent to the target system (Gas Engine Type 6). Given the very close match in product category (Gas Engine series), subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 can be directly applied. The severity rating of 7 is consistent with a piston seizure causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction but not regulatory violation. Occurrence rating of 4 reflects occasional occurrence considering the effective preventive measures like O-Ring specification, TA tightening, oil circuit analysis, and tolerance stack-ups. Detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection by the comprehensive functional testing and component rig tests before shipping. Thus, no rating adjustment is needed for the target Gas Engine Type 6 context."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet - PCJ), function (direct oil to piston gallery), failure mode (No oil), failure cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly - alignment, bolted joint), and failure effect (Piston seizure). The preventive and detective measures match precisely as well ('Design for assembly (Poke Yoke etc.)', 'Assembly instruction' for prevention and 'Assembly trial' for detection). Given the high similarity in product category (gas engines), functional context, failure scenario, and measures, the retrieved risk ratings are directly applicable. 

The retrieved ratings are Severity=7, Occurrence=2, Detection=1. Severity 7 aligns well with piston seizure causing reduced service/customers dissatisfied but not regulatory violation or financial penalty at a high level (consistent with seizure impact). Occurrence rating 2 (unlikely) reflects effective preventive assembly design and instructions. Detection rating 1 indicates near certain detection in assembly trials, plausible given the thorough testing referenced. 

No adjustment necessary due to identical failure context, measures, and closely matched engine product family; minor engine design differences between Type 4 and 6 presumed not to affect these ratings significantly. Thus, these ratings offer accurate and consistent risk evaluation for the target context."
Carbon deposit from oil,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data includes a direct match for the given target context: Product category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), Function (Directs oil to the piston gallery), Failure Mode (No oil), Failure Cause (Carbon deposit from oil), and Failure Effect (Piston seizure). The preventive measures ('TA Oil management', 'Cleanliness standards') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)', 'Field validation (Component inspection)') exactly match the target system's existing measures. Thus, risk ratings are taken directly from the retrieved case. Severity rating is consistent at 7, reflecting 'Reduced service, customers are dissatisfied' due to piston seizure impact. Occurrence rating is 4 indicating occasional failure cause occurrence considering existing preventive measures. Detection rating is 5, meaning detection occurs only through targeted inspection (component inspection), consistent with the given detective measures."
Check-Valve design,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), failure mode No oil, failure cause Check-Valve design, failure effect Piston seizure) exactly matches the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and existing preventive and detective measures. Given the same product category (Gas Engine family), same functional context, and identical preventive/detective measures, the existing risk ratings for Severity (7), Occurrence (4), and Detection (4) are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary."
Crankcase design,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'No oil' caused by 'Crankcase design' leading to 'Piston seizure' on the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' system element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' exactly matches the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem, element, function, failure mode, cause, effect, and measures. The preventive and detective measures are consistent and equivalent. The severity of 7 aligns with a significant failure causing engine damage and reduced service. The occurrence rating of 3 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive measures such as O-Ring spec, tightening specs, oil circuit analysis and tolerance controls. The detection rating of 4 matches the established MCE Functional Testing for oil pressure and thermal monitoring, providing good detectability before customer impact. Therefore, it is justified to adopt the same ratings without adjustment."
Geometry tolerances,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an EXACT MATCH for all key elements except the Product Type which is 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both belong to the same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Piston cooling jet), function, failure mode, failure cause and effect, and have identical preventive and detective measures. Differences between Type 4 and Type 6 do not indicate significant changes in failure consequence, preventive, or detective effectiveness given the similarity of function and measures. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable and transferred directly without adjustment. Severity of 7 aligns well with the impact of piston seizure causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction; occurrence rating of 3 reflects the low likelihood due to effective FPQ and component test rig preventive measures; detection rating of 4 indicates good likelihood of detection via MCE Functional Testing before customer delivery. Hence, ratings are consistent and appropriate for the target system context."
"Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), same function, identical failure mode ('No oil'), same failure cause ('Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)') and failure effect ('Piston seizure'). Preventive and detective measures are also the same ('Design for maintenance (Poke Yoke etc.)', 'Service instruction' and 'Field validation (Fracas)'). Given these exact alignments and consistency in context, the retrieved ratings (Severity=7, Occurrence=2, Detection=5) are applicable and appropriate without adjustment. The severity rating reflects a serious customer impact (piston seizure leading to engine damage and reduced machine availability), but not regulatory violation or company financial damage at the highest level. Occurrence is low likelihood due to effective maintenance design and instructions. Detection is moderate (5) where detection is only possible through targeted inspections or field validation, aligning with detection measures in place."
Nozzle holder,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target system context matches exactly with the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, same system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', function 'Directs oil to the piston gallery', failure mode 'No oil', failure cause 'Nozzle holder', and failure effect 'Piston seizure'. Preventive measures and detective measures in the retrieved data align closely with those provided for the target context. Given the high similarity in product category (both are gas engines), subsystem, system element, and identical failure mode/cause/effect, the existing ratings can be adopted. The severity rating of 7 represents a significant impact (piston seizure leads to reduced service and dissatisfied customers, consistent with the rating band 7-8). The occurrence rating of 4 reflects occasional occurrence considering the current preventive measures which include sealing specs, tightening specs, and oil circuit analysis. The detection rating of 4 indicates a high likelihood of detection due to comprehensive multi-channel engine (MCE) functional testing and component test rigs. This preserves consistency and aligns with the defined rating schema."
Nozzle wear,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The provided target system context matches exactly with the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 in terms of product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Directs oil to piston gallery), failure mode (No oil), failure cause (Nozzle wear), failure effect (Piston seizure), as well as the preventive and detective measures (Oil circuit cleanliness standard and Field validation respectively). Given the high similarity in product category and function, and identical failure mode and cause, the existing ratings from the retrieved data are valid and applicable. No significant change in system environment or measures effectiveness is present to warrant adjustment. Thus, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings are directly applicable to Gas Engine Type 6 with confidence."
PCJN design,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4 with the same Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), Function (Directs oil to the piston gallery), Failure Mode (No oil), Failure Cause (PCJN design), and Failure Effect (Piston seizure). Preventive and detective measures are effectively identical in the target Gas Engine Type 6 context. Given the highly similar system context, functional scope, failure mechanism, and measures, the previous ratings are fully applicable without adjustment. Slight difference in engine model (Type 4 vs Type 6) within the same product category and subsystem does not materially affect severity, occurrence, or detection ratings due to consistent design and test procedures. The severity rating of 7 appropriately reflects the significant customer impact of piston seizure (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction but no regulatory violation). Occurrence rating of 4 aligns with occasional occurrence probability considering the enumerated preventive controls. Detection rating of 4 is justified by good likelihood of detecting PCJN design issues through existing component testing and functional testing measures."
Piston gallery design,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'No oil' caused by 'Piston gallery design' in the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' subsystem of the engine block. The retrieved data provides an EXACT MATCH for all key elements except the product model (Gas Engine Type 4). The product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and existing preventive and detective measures are identical. Since both engines are within the same product category and share highly similar design and test methods, the risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable with no needed adjustments. Severity remains at 7 because piston seizure is a serious failure causing customer dissatisfaction and potential component damage but not regulatory violation or catastrophic financial damage. Occurrence is rated 3, reflecting a low likelihood of failure due to effective preventive measures such as DP007 Piston standards and design verification of the power unit. Detection is rated 4, indicating high likelihood of detecting this failure cause during functional testing and component test rigs prior to delivery. The review confirms perfect alignment with preventive and detective measures, so the original ratings apply to the Type 6 context without modification."
Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 in the Engine Block subsystem for the Piston Cooling Jet (PCJ), with failure mode 'No oil' caused by 'Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system' leading to 'Piston seizure'. The retrieved data shows the exact same failure mode, cause, and effect for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem and system element, with identical preventive and detective measures. Slight difference in product type (Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product category (Gas Engines) and similar operating environments. Therefore, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 apply well but minor evaluation for operational differences is warranted. Since the severity rating concerns piston seizure, a critical engine failure causing reduced service levels and engine damage, this aligns with severity 7 (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction). Preventive measures including component test rig and oil system simulation are effective and keep occurrence low, rated 2 (unlikely). Detection by high-res oil pressure sensors and oil system functional tests is fairly effective, giving detection 4 (high likelihood of detection pre-delivery). Overall, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable without adjustment due to the close similarity in failure context and controls. Thus, the final ratings: Severity = 7, Occurrence = 2, Detection = 4."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston scuff,"EXACT_MATCH with the failure mode 'Intermittent oil', failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)', and failure effect 'Piston scuff' on the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a Gas Engine. The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches exactly the product category (Gas Engine), system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, preventive and detective measures. While the target is Gas Engine Type 6, the close similarity and identical context justify using the same risk ratings directly. The severity rating of 6 is consistent with 'Process disturbance, problems for some customers' due to piston scuff likely causing measurable engine performance degradation but not immediate seizure or regulatory violation. The occurrence rating of 2 considers the effective Design for Assembly and Assembly instruction preventive measures in place that make the failure cause unlikely but still possible given the complexity of assembly alignment with bolted joints. The detection rating of 1 reflects certain detection through the assembly trial process before delivery, consistent with the retrieved data, indicating high confidence in preventing failures reaching the customer undetected."
Carbon deposit from oil,Piston scuff,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data shows an exact match between the target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), function of directing oil to the piston gallery, failure mode 'Intermittent oil', failure cause 'Carbon deposit from oil', and failure effect 'Piston scuff') and a closely matching record from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, preventive and detective measures. Both preventive ('TA Oil management', 'Cleanliness standards') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)', 'Field validation (Component inspection)') match exactly. The slight variation in product model (Type 6 vs Type 4) is within the same product category and subsystem with identical functional context, so this fits the EXACT MATCH criteria. Accordingly, the existing severity (6), occurrence (4), and detection (5) ratings from the retrieved data are directly applicable without adjustment. These ratings reflect a moderate to significant process disturbance for some customers (severity 6), occasional occurrence due to effective preventive measures (occurrence 4), and detection mainly through targeted inspections (detection 5). This is consistent and appropriate given the failure effect and current controls."
Check-Valve design,Piston scuff,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs from the retrieved 'Gas Engine Type 4', but all other factors (Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Piston cooling jet (PCJ), Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect) match exactly, and product category and functional context remain the same. Therefore, the existing risk ratings for 'Check-Valve design' causing 'Intermittent oil' leading to 'Piston scuff' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' can be adapted with reasoning based on possible differences between Types 4 and 6. The preventive and detective measures are identical, indicating similar control effectiveness. Severity should be consistent at 6 (process disturbance, affecting some customers). Occurrence is 4 due to preventive measure '1d oil circuit analysis (PCJ)' and no design changes mentioned that would improve or worsen likelihood substantially. Detection remains at 4, reflecting high likelihood of detection by Component test rig and MCE Functional Testing prior to delivery. Given the newer engine might have slight design improvements but no evidence to support a lower occurrence or detection rating, the original ratings are appropriate without adjustment."
Crankcase design,Piston scuff,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data shows a direct match with the target system context. Product is a gas engine (Type 4 vs Type 6, both in the same product category), subsystem is 'Engine Block', system element is 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', function 'Directs oil to the piston gallery (e.g. bundling)', failure mode 'Intermittent oil', failure cause 'Crankcase design', and failure effect 'Piston scuff' all exactly match the target context. Preventive and detective measures are identical between the retrieved data and the target system. Therefore, risk ratings from the retrieved context are fully applicable without adjustment. Severity is 6 (process disturbance, problems for some customers), Occurrence is 3 (low likelihood considering preventive measures), and Detection is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes through MCE Functional Testing monitoring)."
Geometry tolerances,Piston scuff,"EXACT_MATCH with justification: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Directs oil to the piston gallery), failure mode (Intermittent oil), failure cause (Geometry tolerances), and failure effect (Piston scuff) matches the target system context exactly except for a slight difference in product type (Type 4 vs Type 6 within the same product category: gas engines). The preventive measures ('FPQ', 'Component test rig') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)') match exactly between target and retrieved data. Since the product category and functional context are consistent and the failure mode, cause and effects are the same, we apply an EXACT MATCH rating usage. The severity is rated 6 as piston scuff causes process disturbance and issues for some customers but no regulatory violation or major financial loss. Preventive measures reduce occurrence to rating 3 (low likelihood). Detection capability via functional component testing is relatively good, rated at 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes). Thus, all ratings are directly adopted from the retrieved exact match data."
"Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston scuff,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 system on the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), same function, same failure mode (Intermittent oil), same failure cause (Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)), and same failure effect (Piston scuff). Preventive measures and detective measures exactly match ('Design for maintenance (Poke Yoke etc.)', 'Service instruction' and 'Field validation (Fracas)'). Given minimal differences expected between Gas Engine Type 4 and Type 6 in this context and same maintenance measures, the previously retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Not machined to spec,Piston scuff,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Directs oil to the piston gallery), failure mode (Intermittent oil), failure cause (Not machined to spec), and failure effect (Piston scuff) as in the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4. The preventive measures (FPQ, Drawing specification) and detective measure (MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)) are also the same. Given the high degree of similarity in product category, subsystem, element identity, failure modes, causes, effects, and measures, but recognizing the product difference (Type 6 vs Type 4 gas engine) which might slightly influence occurrence due to different production or design maturity, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are used as base. Severity rating is consistent at 6 due to piston scuff being a moderate process disturbance issue. Preventive measures effectively reduce occurrence to 3 (low likelihood). Detective measure effectiveness yields detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection before delivery). Since the product is closely related and measures match, the same severity and detection ratings apply. Occurrence can be maintained at 3 assuming no degradation of preventive measure effectiveness in the newer product type. Hence, we adopt Severity=6, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 with careful consideration of similarity and verified measure alignment."
Nozzle wear,Piston scuff,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' while the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' but within the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (directing oil to piston gallery), failure mode ('Intermittent oil'), failure cause ('Nozzle wear'), and failure effect ('Piston scuff'). Since preventive and detective measures are also identical ('Oil circuit cleanliness standard (Oil filters requirements)' and 'Field validation (Component inspection)'), the context is highly similar with only a difference in engine variant. Severity should remain consistent at 6 due to same failure effect impact. Occurrence remains at 2 as nozzle wear likelihood with oil cleanliness controls would be similar for engine types 4 and 6. Detection remains at 5 reflecting detection only via targeted component inspection, consistent with field validation. No strong reason to adjust ratings significantly, as engine variants are expected to have similar risk profiles with these measures in place."
Piston gallery design,Piston scuff,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), identical function (Directs oil to the piston gallery), failure mode (Intermittent oil), failure cause (Piston gallery design), and failure effect (Piston scuff) closely matches the target context in Gas Engine Type 6 with the same preventive and detective measures. Despite the difference in engine type (Type 4 to Type 6), the product category (Gas Engine), subsystem, system element, functional and failure characteristics are directly comparable. The preventive ('DP007 Piston', 'Design verification of power unit') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Oil pressure monitoring and piston thermal survey)', 'Component test rig (Nozzle jet optimization)') are identical, suggesting similar effectiveness in both contexts. The severity is maintained at 6, reflecting process disturbance and problems for some customers due to piston scuff. The occurrence rating remains at 3 (low likelihood), as the preventive measures reduce the likelihood of failure cause from piston gallery design. Detection rating stays at 4, indicating a high likelihood of detection via current functional testing before customer impact. Minor consideration is given to possible slight contextual differences between engine types, but no strong evidence demands rating adjustments."
Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system,Piston scuff,"EXACT_MATCH based on strong context alignment: The target is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Piston cooling jet (PCJ), function Directs oil to the piston gallery, failure mode Intermittent oil, failure cause Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system, and failure effect Piston scuff. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with exact matching subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, with identical preventive and detective measures, provides Severity=6, Occurrence=2, Detection=4. Considering the very similar design and preventive/detective controls (component test rig, 1d oil simulation, MCE functional testing with high-resolution sensor, oil system functional test) and no indication of changed risk in Type 6 engines, no rating adjustment is warranted. Severity of 6 fits process disturbance/problems for some customers, consistent with piston scuff impact. Occurrence of 2 reflects unlikely occurrence given effective preventive measures. Detection at 4 indicates high likelihood of detection before customer delivery due to robust functional tests. Hence, the risk rating from Type 4 is directly applicable to Type 6 in the exact context."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH due to direct match of all aspects with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (close at desired pressure), failure mode (Closes not at the desired pressure), failure cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly - alignment, bolted joint), failure effect (Fluctuation of oil flow rate to piston), and with identical preventive and detective measures. The existing ratings Severity=6, Occurrence=2, Detection=1 are consistent with the provided preventive (Design for assembly with Poke Yoke, Assembly instructions) and detective (Assembly trial) measures which effectively minimize occurrence and ensure certain detection before delivery. The severity of 6 corresponds to process disturbance with problems for some customers, which fits the failure effect (fluctuation in oil flow rate). Occurrence is low (2) due to strong preventive measures, and detection is certain (1) due to assembly trials. Therefore, applying these ratings directly is justified and consistent."
Carbon deposit from oil,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure', failure cause 'Carbon deposit from oil', and failure effect 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston' matches almost exactly the target system context except for a different engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) still within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem/function context. Hence, direct reuse with minor adaptation for potential differences in engine design maturity and operating parameters is appropriate. The severity rating of 6 is consistent given process disturbance and some customer impact. Occurrence rating 4 (occasional) fits given identical preventive measures (TA Oil management, Cleanliness standards). Detection rating 5 (detection only through targeted component inspection measures applied) also matches. No indication of major differences in preventive or detective measures that would justify rating changes. Thus, the existing ratings are directly applicable with a confirmation check completed."
Check-Valve design,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 (closely similar product category and system context) shows an exact matching failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' for the same subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', with identical failure cause 'Check-Valve design' and failure effect 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston'. Preventive and detective measures are also the same as in the target context. Given the high similarity (only a minor product type version difference from Type 4 to Type 6) and identical technical conditions including preventive and detective measures, it is appropriate to adopt the same risk ratings. The severity (6) reflects moderate process disturbance that may cause problems for some customers, consistent with oil flow fluctuation impacting piston cooling but not causing catastrophic failure. Occurrence (4) accounts for occasional failure despite 1d oil circuit analysis prevention, and detection (4) corresponds to a high likelihood of detection by component test rig and MCE functional testing before customer delivery."
Check-Valve wear,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The retrieved data provides an exact match of failure mode ('Closes not at the desired pressure'), failure cause ('Check-Valve wear'), and failure effect ('Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston') but for a similar product ('Gas Engine Type 4') within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem (Engine Block). The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', which is a newer or different version but in the same application domain and functional context. Preventive measure ('FPQ (Check valve bore dimensions)') and detective measures (field validation and quality checks) are identical, indicating preventive/detection environment consistency, suggesting the historical ratings are valid but need brief confirmation against any contextual differences in severity and detection assumptions. Severity rating of 6 reflects process disturbance and problems for some customers, consistent with oil flow fluctuation affecting piston cooling, directly relevant to engine operation and durability, which safely transfers. Occurrence rating of 4 (occasional occurrence) matches the failure cause and effectiveness of FPQ preventive control. Detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) matches the available field validation and component test rig inspection methods, indicating moderate detectability prior to customer impact. Since no significant differences exist that would affect these ratings between Type 4 and Type 6 for this specific failure mode, the retrieved ratings are adopted directly for the target context with supporting rationale."
Cleanliness,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match for all failure mode elements except for the product, which is 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function, failure mode, failure cause (Cleanliness), and failure effect (Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston). Preventive and detective measures are identical. Given the strong similarity in technical context and measures, the Severity (6), Occurrence (2), and Detection (5) ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are highly applicable for Gas Engine Type 6 without adjustment. No significant changes in customer impact, operating environment, or effectiveness of controls are evident to warrant rating changes."

Preventive and detective measures are identical: ['FPQ', 'Component test rig'] and ['MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)'], respectively. Failure mode and cause ('Closes not at the desired pressure' caused by 'Geometry tolerances') and failure effect ('Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston') align exactly. The existing retrieved risk ratings are Severity: 6, Occurrence: 3, Detection: 4. Considering the same product environment and identical measures, these ratings remain valid without further adjustment."

Despite slightly different engine type, the product category (Gas Engine), subsystem, system element, failure mode, cause, effect, preventive and detective measures are identical, making this a similar context. Severity rating aligns with the effect on oil flow causing process disturbance and problems for some customers, fitting severity 6, consistent with existing data. Preventive measures ('FPQ', 'Drawing specification') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)') match exactly, supporting the occurrence (3 - low likelihood) and detection (4 - high likelihood of detection during functional test) ratings from retrieved data. Given similar system complexity and operational criticality, no adjustment is required for S, O, D ratings."
Nozzle holder,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH with Gas Engine Type 4 data for same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, considering near identical preventive and detective measures and very similar product context (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4). Severity aligned with failure effect impact on oil flow fluctuation causing process disturbance but no direct severe engine damage, occurrence and detection reflect effective existing measures confirmed by similar testing procedures. Slight contextual differences between Gas Engine Type 4 and 6 do not justify rating adjustment as preventive and detective measures are equivalent and failure effect identical."
Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match for all key parameters except the product is 'Gas Engine Type 4' rather than the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines), subsystems, system elements, failure modes, failure causes, and failure effects are the same. Preventive and detective measures are also identical. Given the structural and functional similarity of the product line and identical preventive/detective measures, adapting the existing risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6 is appropriate with minimal adjustment. The severity rating of 6 fits the failure effect 'Fluctuation of oil flow rate to the piston' as a process disturbance and potential problem for some customers, consistent with this engine type's customer impact. Preventive measures like component test rigs and 1d oil system simulations are effective, thus occurrence rated low at 2 (unlikely). Detection via high resolution oil pressure sensors and oil system functional tests is considered likely at rating 4. Overall, the rating set from the similar context is fully applicable with no changes needed."

The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', a closely related product category and functional context. Preventive measure ('FEA Modal Analysis') and detective measure ('Hammer/Modal test') are identical. Given the similar design environment and measures, the retrieved ratings of Severity=6, Occurrence=4, and Detection=4 are directly applicable without adjustment. Severity 6 reflects process disturbance with problems for some customers, fitting oil flow rate fluctuation to the piston impact. Occurrence 4 denotes occasional occurrence given preventive FEA modal analysis. Detection 4 means a high likelihood of detection before customer delivery via hammer/modal testing. Therefore, exact ratings are adapted as best fit for the target context."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data presents an exact match in all key elements except for the product being 'Gas Engine Type 4' compared to the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'.

Preventive and detective measures are also exactly the same. Given the similarity in technology and design principles between Gas Engine Types 4 and 6 in the same functional context, the existing risk ratings can be adopted with minimal adjustment. The severity remains at 7, consistent with failure effect piston seizure causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction. The occurrence rating of 2 indicates that preventive measures such as design for assembly (Poke Yoke) and assembly instructions are effective in significantly reducing failure cause likelihood. The detection rating of 1 reflects strong detectability via assembly trial, ensuring near-certain detection pre-delivery. Slight product advancement from Type 4 to Type 6 is unlikely to negatively impact these ratings in the assembly process and preventive/detective measure effectiveness. Hence, we retain the retrieved ratings with confidence."

Preventive measures ('FPQ', 'Component test rig') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)') are identical. Severity rating is 7 due to piston seizure causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction but no regulatory violation or catastrophic financial damage explicitly stated. Occurrence rating is 3, reflecting low likelihood with current preventive measures. Detection rating is 4, indicating high likelihood of detection during functional component testing before delivery. Considering the similarity in engine type (same product category), identical functional context and matching measures, direct transfer of retrieved ratings is appropriate without adjustment for context differences."

The preventive measures (Design for maintenance (Poke Yoke etc.), Service instruction) and detective measures (Field validation (Fracas)) exactly match the target system context, ensuring applicability of the risk ratings without modification. The severity rating of 7 corresponds to the serious customer impact of piston seizure causing reduced service/dissatisfaction but no direct regulatory violation or extreme financial damage, consistent with the scale. Occurrence rating is 2, reflecting low likelihood due to effective preventive measures (design and instructions). Detection rating is 5 indicating detection is possible only through targeted inspection methods like field validation, not certain or high likelihood in earlier process steps. This maintains internal consistency with the rating definitions and prior assessments for the exact failure scenario."

Preventive measures (FPQ, Drawing specification) and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing - Component Inspection) are the same, indicating consistent process controls. Severity rating of 7 reflects serious impact (piston seizure) leading to reduced service and possible engine damage, appropriate for both Type 4 and Type 6 gas engines. Occurrence rating 3 (low likelihood) aligns with existing effective preventive controls. Detection rating 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) matches the capability of MCE functional testing for such machining defects. Since the product type differs but within the same category and identical functional context, we adopt the same ratings with no adjustment needed due to identical preventive and detective measures and similar failure impact and operational environment."
Nozzle holder,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, failure mode 'Contact to piston' caused by 'Nozzle holder' resulting in 'Piston seizure'. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' exactly matches subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure cause and effect with minor product generation difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) within the same product category (Gas Engines). Preventive and detective measures are effectively identical. Severity rating (7) reflects severe impact (piston seizure causing reduced service/customers dissatisfaction but not regulatory violation or financial catastrophe), which is consistent across engines. Occurrence rating of 4 indicates an occasional occurrence given the existing preventive measures (e.g. O-Ring specification, TA Tightening specification, oil circuit analysis, tolerance stack-up), which fits for nozzle holder faults across similar engine types. Detection rating of 4 means a high likelihood of detection through existing MCE functional testing and component test rigs prior to customer delivery, consistent with preventive/detective measures listed. Given analogous preventive/detective measures and same failure circumstances, applying retrieved ratings directly with no adjustment is appropriate."
PCJN design,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target product 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block). The system element, function, failure mode ('Contact to piston'), failure cause ('PCJN design'), and failure effect ('Piston seizure') match exactly, except that the retrieved data corresponds to Gas Engine Type 4. Preventive and detective measures in the target system align completely with those in the retrieved data. Given the strong similarity and consistent measures, the retrieved risk ratings can be transferred with minimal adjustment. Severity remains 7 because 'Piston seizure' impacts the engine's operation causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction. Occurrence remains 4 (occasional) as preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate risk. Detection remains 4 (high likelihood detection through functional testing and trials) reflecting the robust detection measures reported."
Piston,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH - The retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), failure mode (Contact to piston), failure cause (Piston), and failure effect (Piston seizure) matches the target context closely. The preventive and detective measures are identical ('3D Modal clash check', 'Tolerance stack up' for preventive and 'MCE Functional Testing (OK/NOK)', 'Assembly Trial' for detective). Given the same product category (Gas Engine), similar engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6), and identical functional and failure characteristics, the existing ratings apply directly without adjustment. Severity rating 7 is justified as piston seizure causes reduced service with customer dissatisfaction but no direct regulatory violation or extreme financial damage. Occurrence rating of 3 corresponds to low likelihood considering the effective preventive measures. Detection rating 4 indicates high likelihood of detection during functional testing and assembly trials. These ratings are consistent and appropriate with the preventive/detective controls in place and the failure scenario described."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on the strong retrieval match from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem 'Engine Block', with identical SystemElement 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', same Function 'Clearance to all neighboring systems', identical FailureMode 'Contact to piston', same FailureCause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)', and same FailureEffect 'Piston seizure'. The preventive measures and detective measures also match exactly. Although the product types differ (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6), both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem context is identical. Therefore, the exact retrieved ratings are applicable without modification. Specifically, severity rating of 7 fits the impact as a piston seizure causing reduced service or dissatisfaction but not regulatory violation or catastrophic damage. Occurrence rating of 2 aligns with the presence of effective preventive measures like poka-yoke and assembly instructions, indicating unlikely failure cause. Detection rating of 1 matches a high certainty of detection via assembly trials before delivery. Thus, the existing ratings directly apply per methodology for EXACT MATCH."
Crankcase design,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and retrieved data system (Gas Engine Type 4) belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet), function (Clearance to all neighboring systems), failure mode (Contact to piston), failure cause (Crankcase design), and failure effect (Piston seizure). Preventive and detective measures are exactly the same in both contexts. The only difference is engine type version (Type 6 vs Type 4), which is assumed to have comparable design maturity and operational environment. Therefore, the ratings from the similar context are directly applicable without adjustment."
Geometry tolerances,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), Failure Mode: Contact to piston, Failure Cause: Geometry tolerances, Failure Effect: Piston seizure) exactly matches the retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and identical preventive and detective measures ('FPQ', 'Component test rig' and 'MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)'). Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engine) and share the same functional context, suggesting direct applicability of retrieved ratings. The severity rating of 7 aligns with the impact being 'Reduced service, customers are dissatisfied' due to piston seizure—matching the original rating and consistent with the severity scale. The occurrence rating of 3 reflects low likelihood considering effective preventive measures ('FPQ' and 'Component test rig'). Detection rating of 4 indicates high likelihood of detection in the subsequent MCE Functional Testing, consistent with the detection scale and the given detective measure. No adjustments are needed since preventive and detective measures are the same, severity impact is consistent, and context is equivalent except for a minor product version difference (Type 6 vs Type 4), within same family rules. Hence, exact match is applied, and extracted ratings used as-is."
"Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 exactly matches the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Clearance to all neighboring systems), failure mode (Contact to piston), failure cause (Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)) and failure effect (Piston seizure). The preventive measures ('Design for maintenance (Poke Yoke etc.)', 'Service instruction') and detective measures ('Field validation (Fracas)') are identical to those in the target context. Since the product category (Gas Engine) and functional context align closely albeit one generation difference in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6), no adjustment to ratings is justified. Severity is consistently rated as 7 for piston seizure scenarios causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction without regulatory violation or financial damage beyond the expected impact. Occurrence rating of 2 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive maintenance design and service instructions. Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection only possible through targeted inspection (Field validation(Fracas)), not certain in routine process. Thus, existing ratings are directly applicable and consistent with the current preventive and detective measures."
Not machined to specification,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), Failure Mode 'Contact to piston', Failure Cause 'Not machined to specification', and Failure Effect 'Piston seizure'. The new target system is Gas Engine Type 6 but shares the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive measures ('FPQ', 'Drawing specification') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)') match exactly. Therefore, ratings extracted from the Gas Engine Type 4 context for these failure parameters are directly applicable without modification."
Nozzle holder design or malfunction,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data closely matches the target system in terms of product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet - PCJ), function ('Clearance to all neighboring systems'), failure mode ('Contact to piston'), failure cause ('Nozzle holder'), and failure effect ('Piston seizure'). The main difference is product version (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6) which is within the same product category and similar operating conditions. Preventive and detective measures provided are also highly consistent with those in the retrieved data, supporting the direct adaptation of ratings with minor consideration for possible Type 6 specific design improvements. The retrieved data assigns Severity=7 for 'Piston seizure' failure effect, consistent with a significant engine damage causing customer dissatisfaction and operational disruption (Severity in range 7-8). The occurrence rating for 'Nozzle holder' cause is 4 (occasional occurrence) considering existing preventive measures including O-Ring specs, tightening and analysis. The detection rating is 4, indicating detection is through functional testing and component inspections before customer delivery. These ratings align well with the target context. Given the similarity in context, functional criticality, and existing measures effectiveness, no major adjustments are needed. Hence, the adapted risk ratings for the Gas Engine Type 6 scenario are Severity=7, Occurrence=4, Detection=4."
Piston design or dimensional deviations,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure mode 'Contact to piston' and failure cause related to design/dimensional deviations closely matches the target Gas Engine Type 6 context. Preventive and detective measures are similar with advanced 3D clash check, tolerance stack-up, FPQ, component test rig, and functional/assembly testing, indicating comparable risk control. Severity rating of 7 for 'Piston seizure' is consistent with high impact affecting engine operation, preserving customer dissatisfaction and substantial repair costs. Occurrence rating for cause 'Piston design or dimensional deviations' aligns with existing ratings for geometry tolerances, piston, and related causes from 3 (low to occasional occurrence), consistent with effective preventive measures. Detection rating aligns with detection capabilities of functional testing and assembly trials, set at 4 (high likelihood of detection before customer delivery). Overall ratings adapted from similar context while confirming applicability in the current Gas Engine Type 6 environment."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data is for 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' system element, with exact matching failure mode 'Contact to crankshaft', failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)', and failure effect 'Piston seizure'. The preventive measures ('Design for assembly (Poke Yoke etc.)', 'Assembly instruction') and detective measures ('Assembly trial') are identical to the target system. Given the high similarity in product category (both are gas engines), subsystem and functional context, these ratings reflect the actual risk considering the existing measures and the criticality of piston seizure as a failure effect. Hence, the exact match ratings are applicable directly to the target system with no adjustment necessary."
Crankcase design,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Contact to crankshaft' on 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' caused by 'Crankcase design' resulting in 'Piston seizure' matches retrieved data exactly in terms of product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (PCJ), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, except that the known context is 'Gas Engine Type 4' while the target is 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Given the high similarity in system design and preventive/detective measures already in place and consistent across engine types with strong similarity, the retrieved ratings can be adapted directly with confidence. Severity remains rated at 7 indicating reduced service/dissatisfied customer level due to piston seizure, which does not violate regulations but results in significant engine failure. Occurrence rated at 3 corresponds to low likelihood due to robust preventive design (O-Ring specs, tolerance stack-ups, 3D clash checks, oil circuit analysis) effectively reducing frequency of cause. Detection rated at 4 reflects high likelihood of detecting failure during MCE Functional Testing (oil pressure, thermal survey, leakage check) before customer delivery. No contextual factors in Type 6 engines suggest altered failure impact or detection probabilities. Hence, ratings are consistent and appropriate with minor adaptation rationalized by similarity in system and measures execution."
Crankshaft design or dimensional deviations,Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet, PCJ), function (Clearance to all neighboring systems), failure mode ('Contact to crankshaft'), and failure effect ('Piston seizure') as a retrieved failure mode from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the product version differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the functional and technical context is highly similar, and preventive/detective measures are comparable ('3D Modal clash check', 'Tolerance stack up', 'Assembly trial'). The retrieved data shows a severity rating of 7 for 'Piston seizure', occurrence of 2 for 'Crankshaft' cause with the matching preventive measures, and detection of 1 with 'Assembly trial'. Given similarity of preventive/detective measures and severity implication, the severity remains unchanged at 7. The occurrence rating can be adopted as 2 (Unlikely) due to effective preventive measures. Detection rating remains 1 (Certain detection in subsequent processes) due to assembly trial check. Minor adaptation is unnecessary as context is functionally and technically consistent between engine types, fulfilling SIMILAR_CONTEXT criteria."
Geometry tolerances,Piston seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Clearance to all neighboring systems), failure mode (Contact to crankshaft), failure cause (Geometry tolerances), and failure effect (Piston seizure) matches exactly with the target system context in terms of product category (both are gas engines with similar architecture). The preventive measures ('FPQ', 'Component test rig') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)') are identical in both contexts, ensuring consistent risk control effectiveness. Therefore, no adaptation is necessary and the retrieved risk ratings can be directly applied. Severity is rated at 7 consistent with a reduced service and customer dissatisfaction level for piston seizure but excluding regulatory or catastrophic financial violation. Occurrence is rated at 3 indicating a low likelihood of failure cause geometry tolerance breaches given current preventive measures. Detection is set at 4 reflecting a high likelihood of detection through component inspection functional testing before reaching the customer."
"Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)",Piston seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Contact to crankshaft' on 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', caused by 'Incorrect maintenance activity (alignment, bolted joint)', and effect 'Piston seizure'. Retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows an EXACT_MATCH for identical Subsystem, System Element, Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, Failure Effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. Given the high technical similarity of Gas Engine Type 6 to Type 4 in the same product category and subsystem, the severity rating remains consistent at 7 due to customer dissatisfaction from piston seizure (reduced service level). Preventive measures ('Design for maintenance', 'Service instruction') and detective measure ('Field validation (Fracas)') are the same and show effectiveness resulting in low occurrence (2) and medium detection (5) ratings in the retrieved data. The operational environment and maintenance practices are assumed comparable, implying no need to adjust occurrence or detection. Therefore, the risk ratings from Type 4 context are fully applicable with slight caution due to possible Type 6 nuances but no contradictory info. Severity: 7, Occurrence: 2, Detection: 5."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)",Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH based on very close matching failure mode, cause, effect, system element, preventive and detective measures in the same product category (Gas Engine), similar subsystem (Engine Block) and very similar product (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6). The retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows a Severity of 6, Occurrence of 2, and Detection of 1 for identical failure mode and cause with the same preventive and detective measures. Given there's no indication that Type 6's context would significantly increase or reduce these ratings and measures are identical, we directly adopt these ratings to maintain consistency and accuracy."
Carbon deposit from oil,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an EXACT MATCH for all key parameters except the product version: the failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' caused by 'Carbon deposit from oil' affecting 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston' on a Piston cooling jet (PCJ) in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4. Our target system is Gas Engine Type 6, same product category (gas engines), same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effects, and identical preventive and detective measures. Given the close product family relation and identical context, the direct ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are highly applicable. Minor Type upgrade may imply incremental design or operational improvements but no specific data suggests significant change in failure behavior or detection capability for this failure mode and cause. Thus, the original Severity=6, Occurrence=4, Detection=5 are valid starting points. Severity: 6 reflects a process disturbance and problem for some customers, consistent given the effect on piston oil flow fluctuation. Occurrence: 4 indicates occasional occurrence considering preventive measures (TA Oil management, Cleanliness standards), reasonable given the cause is carbon deposit which is partially controlled but can still appear. Detection: 5 means detection only via targeted inspection (MCE Functional testing and field validation), consistent with the measures. No adjustment needed as the system context and measures are nearly identical, so no risk rating change required."
Check-Valve design,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data: The failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' caused by 'Check-Valve design' on 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in the subsystem 'Engine Block' corresponds exactly to the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, Product Category, and functional context. The preventive measure '1d oil circuit analysis (PCJ)' and detective measures 'Component test rig' and 'MCE Functional Testing (Oil pressure monitoring and piston thermal survey)' align perfectly with the target context. Severity rating of 6 is consistent for the failure effect 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston'. Occurrence rating of 4 reflects occasional occurrence given the effectiveness of preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 indicates high likelihood of detection via existing test rig and functional tests. Since the systems are similar engine types with same product category and function, no adaptation is needed, and the ratings can be adopted directly with confidence."
Cleanliness,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Close at the desired pressure (minimize hysteresis)), failure mode (Closes not at the desired pressure), failure cause (Cleanliness), and failure effect (Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston). The preventive and detective measures are exactly the same: ['TA Oil management', 'Cleanliness standards'] and ['MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)', 'Field validation (Component inspection)'] respectively. Given that the product family is closely related (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4), the operating conditions, customer impact, and measures are expected to be very similar. The severity rating is directly applicable (6) consistent with process disturbances/problems for some customers without regulatory impact or severe financial damage. The occurrence rating is 2 (Unlikely) reflecting efficient existing preventive measures maintaining cleanliness. The detection rating is 5 (Detection only through targeted inspection), consistent with the use of functional component inspection tests. Minor differences between engine types 4 and 6 do not justify changing ratings as the failure context and controls are effectively identical. Hence, adapting the retrieved ratings as-is with justification for product type similarity and identical controls is appropriate."
Geometry tolerances,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH with adaptation reasoning: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the exact failure scenario (Piston cooling jet (PCJ), closing not at desired pressure due to geometry tolerances causing fluctuation of oil flow rate) perfectly matches the target context (Gas Engine Type 6, same subsystem, element, function, failure mode, failure cause and effect, with identical preventive and detective measures). The slight product version difference is within the same product category and system context, so ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are valid. Preventive measures (FPQ, Component test rig) strongly reduce occurrence to 3 (low likelihood). Detective measure (MCE Functional Testing) supports high probability of detection (Detection rating 4). Severity consistent with failure effect causing process disturbance affecting some customers (Severity 6) is appropriate and aligns with schema. Therefore, exact match data is applicable without adjustment."
Not machined to spec,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet), function (Close at desired pressure), failure mode (Closes not at the desired pressure), failure cause (Not machined to spec), failure effect (Fluctuation of oil flow rate to piston), preventive measures (FPQ, Drawing specification), and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing) exactly matches the target context in Gas Engine Type 6. Both belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) with closely related engine types, same functional context, same failure characteristics, and identical existing measures. Thus, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from this existing data are directly applicable without adjustment. The severity rating of 6 corresponds to process disturbance and problems for some customers due to oil flow fluctuation, which is consistent with impact expectations for piston cooling. The occurrence rating of 3 indicates low likelihood given the effective preventive measures (FPQ and drawing specs). The detection rating of 4 reflects a high likelihood of detection through MCE Functional Testing (component inspection), consistent with the detective strategy. Therefore, the provided ratings are accurate and appropriate for the target system."
Nozzle holder,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH: The exact failure scenario for 'Closes not at the desired pressure' caused by 'Nozzle holder' in the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem is found in Gas Engine Type 4. The product category (Gas Engines), subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect match perfectly except for a slight product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) but still within the same product family and context. Preventive and detective measures are also highly consistent in nature and scope. Thus, the retrieved risk ratings (Severity 6, Occurrence 4, Detection 4) can be directly applied without adjustment since the operating context and risk controls are aligned, and the impact on downstream systems and customer would be equivalent."
Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Retrieved data shows an exact match on all relevant parameters except the product variant (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6). Both are within the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function, failure mode, failure cause, preventive and detective measures. The operational and functional context is very similar but not identical product version, so ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are highly relevant for Gas Engine Type 6. Severity remains consistent because the failure effect (fluctuation of oil flow rate to piston) and its customer/system impact remain unchanged. Occurrence rating of 2 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive measures ('Component test rig', '1d Oil system simulation'). Detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection using existing 'MCE Functional Testing (High resolution oil pressure sensor)' and 'Oil system functional test'. Therefore, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable without modification, preserving consistency and accuracy."
Vibration,Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston,"EXACT_MATCH: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), function 'Close at the desired pressure', failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure', failure cause 'Vibration', failure effect 'Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston') matches retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, effect, preventive measure (FEA Modal Analysis) and detective measure (Hammer/Modal test). The product category and functional context are the same (gas engines, similar engine block subsystem and PCJ). The severity rating 6 is consistent with process disturbance/problems for some customers. The occurrence rating 4 aligns with 'occasional occurrence' given current preventive FEA modal analysis and detective hammer/modal test. Detection rating 4 reflects 'high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes' which matches hammer/modal test effectiveness. Minor product version differences (Type 4 vs Type 6) do not materially impact the risk ratings given essentially same component function and failure mode context. Thus, original retrieved ratings are accurate and consistent for this failure mode and causes."
"Liner landing design (geometry, surface roughness, material properties)",Liner landing surface damage leading to compromised structural integrity of the liner-to-crankcase interface,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with analytical adaptation: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs from the retrieved 'Gas Engine Type 4', but the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Contact to crankcase), failure mode ('Liner contact disruption at top'), failure cause ('Liner landing design (geometry, surface roughness, material properties)'), and failure effect ('Liner landing surface damage leading to compromised structural integrity') match closely. Corresponding preventive and detective measures are essentially identical in scope and detail, indicating similar control effectiveness. Severity rating is directly transferable as the impact on structural integrity and customer/system dissatisfaction is consistent (rated 7). Occurrence rating from retrieved data is 3, indicating low likelihood, aligned with robust preventive measures like design guidelines, simulations, and tolerance stack ups — appropriate for the similar complex engine design and controls in Type 6. Detection rating of 5 is consistent with detection by targeted inspection methods (component inspection, oil analysis, performance measurement, assembly tests) that are present in both contexts. Given no significant changes in detection capabilities or preventive measure effectiveness are evident from the information, the same ratings apply well with high confidence. Minor differences in engine type do not affect the failure risk profile here due to the identical functional and component framework."
Geometry tolerances deviation or incorrect tolerance specification affecting mating surfaces,Liner landing surface damage resulting in micro-movements and fretting corrosion,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Liner contact disruption at top' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data shows an EXACT match for very similar failure mode, function, failure cause ('Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'), and failure effect ('Liner landing surface damage') in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both are gas engines, same subsystem and component, with matching failure mode descriptors and preventive/detective measures. Hence, the prior risk ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection are highly applicable. Some estimate adjustment might occur due to possible improvements or differences in newer engine type 6, but given preventive/detective measures are very similar, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without changes. Severity is 7 due to customer dissatisfaction from liner surface damage causing fretting corrosion and micro-movements. Occurrence is 3 (low likelihood) considering effective preventive measures including liner design standard, FEA, and drawing specs. Detection is 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) because detection relies on functional tests and inspections like Fujifilm assembly test and MCE functional tests, consistent with described detective measures."
Transient engine operation stresses during startup or cooldown cycles causing thermal distortions,Liner landing surface damage reducing sealing effectiveness and liner stability,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context relates to a Gas Engine Type 6, while the retrieved data is primarily from Gas Engine Type 4. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Contact to crankcase), failure mode ('Liner contact disruption at top'), failure cause ('Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)'), and failure effect ('Liner landing surface damage reducing sealing effectiveness and liner stability'). Preventive and detective measures listed are also closely aligned and highly similar. Given the strong overlap with only a slight difference in engine type version, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable but warrant minor adjustment due to potential variations in operational parameters and improved design practices in the newer engine type. Severity is consistent as it directly addresses liner surface damage with impact on sealing and stability, rated 7 in retrieved context indicating reduced service and customer dissatisfaction—this is applicable without change. Occurrence is rated 5 indicating occasional failures due to transient operations despite robust preventive FEA and simulation analyses; given similar measures, this rating remains appropriate. Detection is rated 5, indicating detection through targeted inspections such as MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation; since detection methods are equivalent, this rating also remains valid. Overall, the slight context difference (Type 6 vs Type 4) does not justify deviation from the established ratings. Hence, the retrieved ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection are used directly with confirmation of alignment to current measures."
Assembly process errors or inadequate design for assembly influencing liner seating accuracy,Liner landing surface damage and potential functional interruption due to improper contact,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block, system element Cylinder liner assembly, and the failure mode 'Liner contact disruption at top' caused by 'Assembly process errors or inadequate design for assembly'. Retrieved data shows a very similar failure mode ('Liner contact disruption at top') in Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, system element, function and failure cause. Preventive measures in both contexts include '3D Model analysis' and the detective measures include 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)'. Thus, the contexts are highly similar, differing only in engine type generation (Type 6 vs Type 4). Given the strong match but evolved product generation, ratings from the retrieved data are adopted with minor confidence. The failure effect severity rating for 'Liner landing surface damage' is 7, consistent with potential functional interruption and customer dissatisfaction (reduced service). Occurrence rating is 3, reflecting moderate likelihood due to existing preventive measure '3D Model analysis' that reduces but does not eliminate assembly errors. Detection rating is 4, indicating high likelihood of detection via the 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)'. Therefore, ratings are consistent and suitable for the new context without adjustment. This is a classic exact or near exact match with no significant change in failure cause or effects and similar preventive/detective measures, just different engine type. Hence, SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating adapted directly from Type 4 to Type 6 is appropriate."
"Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.) insufficient to maintain required load path",Engine shutdown due to liner crack from excessive vibration or stress concentration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and retrieved data (Gas Engine Type 4) are within the same product category (gas engines) and share the identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Contact to crankcase), failure mode (Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase), failure cause (Liner landing design), and failure effect (Engine shutdown due to liner crack). Although different engine versions, the functional and failure context is highly aligned. Preventive and detective measures are also closely matched. Hence, the existing retrieved ratings are directly relevant. However, since Type 6 may have some incremental improvements in simulation capabilities and testing protocols but still fundamentally similar, slight adjustment is considered unnecessary given the thorough preventive and detective measures listed. The severity rating is consistent with the critical impact (engine shutdown). Occurrence is rated low (3) reflecting effective preventive measures. Detection (4) reflects good but not certain detection before customer impact via multiple functional and field tests. Thus, these ratings are adopted without modification."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification leading to gaps or misfit,Engine shutdown from liner crack initiation due to uneven loading,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase' in the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) matches closely with retrieved data for the same failure mode, same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Contact to crankcase), failure cause (Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification), and failure effect (Engine shutdown from liner crack initiation due to uneven loading) in Gas Engine Type 4. Both are large gas engines within the same product category, Engine Block subsystem, and similar functional context. Preventive and detective measures align closely as well. The retrieved data indicates an occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood) and detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) with severity rated as 7 for engine shutdown from liner crack. Given these strong similarities but a slightly newer engine type, ratings are adapted but remain consistent to the original data since preventive and detective measures match. Severity is rated 7 (reduced service/customers dissatisfied due to engine shutdown). Occurrence remains 3 due to effective preventive measures like FEA simulation and drawing specification controlling geometry tolerances. Detection remains 4 because multiple functional tests and assembly tests provide high detection probability before delivery, consistent with existing measures. This balanced approach reflects the maturity of the design and testing process while acknowledging that geometry tolerances issues can still sporadically occur and are reliably detected. Overall, SIMILAR_CONTEXT is best applied with minor to no adjustments based on the retrieved knowledge."
Assembly process / Design for assembly shortcomings causing misalignment,Engine shutdown caused by reduced structural integrity of the liner-to-crankcase interface,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved vector data from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), identical failure mode 'Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase', same failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', and same failure effect 'Engine shutdown due to liner crack'. Product types (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4) are very similar within the same product category (industrial gas engines). Preventive measure '3D Model analysis' and detective measure 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)' exactly match the retrieved data. Thus, the existing ratings are directly applicable. Severity rating is aligned with the critical impact of engine shutdown (rated 7) indicating reduced service and customer dissatisfaction but not regulatory violation or severe financial damage at the highest level. Occurrence rating is moderate (3) reflecting effective preventive measure '3D Model analysis' reducing occurrence likelihood. Detection rating is moderate (4) corresponding to detection during assembly trial, which provides reasonable but not certain detection before customer delivery."
Part not machined to specification causing dimensional deviations,Engine shutdown due to sudden failure from improper liner seating,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' but the retrieved closest data refers to 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Contact to crankcase), failure mode ('Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase'), failure cause ('Part not machined to specification causing dimensional deviations'), and failure effect (engine shutdown due to improper liner seating) very closely matching the target context. Preventive and detective measures also align well in type and scope. Minor differences in engine type could lead to slight variation in occurrence or detection, but since measures and failure consequences are similar, the retrieved ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 provide a strong basis. The severity rating is consistent with a serious failure effect causing engine shutdown (rating 7), indicating customer dissatisfaction and reduced service but no regulation violation or catastrophic safety risk. Occurrence rating at 3 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive measures like design specs, simulations, and tolerances. Detection rating at 4 corresponds to a high likelihood of detection through existing component and field inspections before severe failure. These ratings fit the provided preventive and detective measures well for the target system. Therefore, slight adaptation is not needed, and retrieved ratings are applied as is with confidence."
"Liner design issues (geometry, material selection, surface finish flaws)",Engine shutdown via liner fatigue and crack propagation under cyclic loading,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode 'Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase' in the Cylinder liner assembly of the Engine Block. Retrieved data shows this failure mode with the same failure cause 'Liner design (geometry, material etc.)' in Gas Engine Type 4 under essentially identical functional and subsystem context. The preventive and detective measures listed in the retrieved data closely match those of target context, indicating similar risk control effectiveness. Although the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, the product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect match well, qualifying this as a similar context scenario. Severity rating is listed as 7 (engine shutdown due to liner crack), which aligns well with the consequence of engine shutdown by liner fatigue crack propagation in the target system, consistent across the product category. Occurrence rating is 3, reflecting low likelihood due to extensive preventive simulations, material characterization, and design validation; the target system's preventive measures are equivalent or better, so this rating is retained. Detection rating is 4, representing a high likelihood of detection through multiple functional, thermal, overload, cavitation, assembly tests, and field validations before delivery; the target's detective measures are comparable, thus detection rating remains valid. Therefore, adopting the retrieved ratings directly with minor validation to the target system is appropriate."
Wrong maintenance procedures causing loosening or damage at contact interface,Engine shutdown due to progressive damage and liner displacement,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', while all retrieved data correspond to 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Contact to crankcase), failure mode (Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase), failure cause being 'Wrong maintenance'. The preventive measures ('TA Cylinder Head Maintenance', 'TA Power Unit Maintenance', 'Design for maintenance', 'Service instruction') and detective measures (multiple MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation inspections) align almost exactly with the retrieved data's description for 'Wrong maintenance'. The severity rating in related failure modes causing engine shutdown or damage is consistently rated 7, reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and severe operational impact but not regulatory violation or total catastrophic failure, thus appropriate here. Occurrence for wrong maintenance in retrieved cases is rated as 1 (nearly impossible) due to strong preventive maintenance and design controls; given similar strong measures exist, this rating is directly applicable. Detection rating associated with 'Wrong maintenance' failure cause paired with 'Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase' is 4 in retrieved data, indicating a high likelihood that the failure cause will be detected in subsequent processes or inspections before failure reaches the customer. Since the existing detective measures in the target context are extensive and match those in the retrieved context, the detection rating remains consistent. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are adopted directly with consistent reasoning for product generation difference: severity 7, occurrence 1, detection 4."
Crankcase design negligence leading to poor interface conformity and tolerance stack-up,Engine shutdown originating from structural failure at liner interface,"EXACT_MATCH: Retrieved data shows an exact context match for Product Category (Gas Engine), System Element (Cylinder liner assembly), Subsystem (Engine Block), Function (Contact to crankcase), Failure Mode (Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase), Failure Cause (Crankcase design), and Failure Effect (Engine shutdown due to liner crack). The closest matching failure effect severity rating is provided as 7. Preventive measures and detective measures align very well between the retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 and the target Gas Engine Type 6, with same advanced simulations and testing methods applied. Occurrence for failure cause 'Crankcase design' is consistently rated as 3 considering effective preventive measures (design guidelines, FEA, tolerance stack-up, MBS, liner distortion analysis). Detection effectiveness matches well as the detection rating is 4, based on functional testing, field validation, overload and endurance runs, and LOC and oil filter monitoring. Since the context and technical controls match closely and the impact is clearly an engine shutdown from structural failure (high customer impact), severity remains at 7. Occurrence and detection are retained without changes due to similar mitigation and detection environments in the updated product generation."
"Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.)",Liner landing surface damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Retrieved data shows an almost exact match in system element (Cylinder liner assembly), subsystem (Engine Block), function (Clearance to crankcase), failure mode (Liner contact disruption at top), failure cause (Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.)), and failure effect (Liner landing surface damage), but for Gas Engine Type 4 instead of Gas Engine Type 6. The product category (gas engines), subsystem, and functional context are consistent. Preventive and detective measures listed are nearly identical, indicating similar risk controls and detection capabilities. Given this strong similarity, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings of the Gas Engine Type 4 context are directly applicable with no need for adjustments, since customer impact, operating environment, and measures effectiveness are expected to be analogous in the Type 6. Severity is 7 due to customer dissatisfaction and reduced service from liner surface damage; Occurrence is 3 reflecting low likelihood given effective preventive measures; Detection is 5 denoting detection primarily through targeted inspections prior to delivery. Therefore, applying these ratings ensures consistency with established data for the closely related engine type."
Bolted joint design,Liner landing surface damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for same subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', function 'Clearance to crankcase', failure mode 'Liner contact disruption at top', failure cause 'Bolted joint design', and failure effect 'Liner landing surface damage'. Preventive measures ('GASENGDP049 Bolted joint', 'FEA Simulation') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance measurement)', 'Field Validation (Performance monitoring)', 'Assembly test (Fujifilm)') closely match the target system context. Since the product difference is only a newer engine Type 6 vs Type 4 with very similar context and measures, retrieved ratings are fully applicable without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Liner landing surface damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data includes two exact matches for the failure mode 'Liner contact disruption at top' with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and failure effect 'Liner landing surface damage' within the same Product category (Gas Engine), same System Element (Cylinder liner assembly) and Subsystem (Engine Block), and the same function ('Clearance to crankcase'). Preventive and detective measures also perfectly match: preventive is '3D Model analysis' and detective is 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)'. The existing ratings (Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=4) are consistent with the definitions: Severity 7 represents reduced service and dissatisfied customers due to liner surface damage impacting function; Occurrence 3 reflects a low likelihood due to effective preventive measure; Detection 4 indicates high likelihood of detection in assembly trials before delivery. Therefore, these ratings can be directly applied without adjustment."
"Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.)",Liner landing surface damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from the Gas Engine product family, specifically 'Gas Engine Type 4', matching the target subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Clearance to crankcase), failure mode (Liner contact disruption at bottom), failure cause (Liner landing design), and failure effect (Liner landing surface damage). Preventive and detective measures between Gas Engine Type 4 and target Gas Engine Type 6 are nearly identical in scope and advanced simulation/testing methods, indicating comparable control effectiveness. The severity rating of 7 (reduced service, customers dissatisfied) applies consistently for liner surface damage. Occurrence rating of 3 reflects low likelihood due to robust preventive measures. Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection through targeted inspections, consistent with the existing MCE functional testing and field validation in both product versions. Minor advances in Type 6 design or operating environment not indicated; thus, no adjustment needed. Therefore, adopting the retrieved ratings is valid with no significant rating changes."
Bolted joint design,Liner landing surface damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 matches exactly in product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Clearance to crankcase), failure mode (Liner contact disruption at bottom), failure cause (Bolted joint design), failure effect (Liner landing surface damage), and preventive/detective measures. Despite being a different engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6), the functional context and design measures are identical, justifying direct use of the provided ratings. Preventive measures ('GASENGDP049 Bolted joint', 'FEA Simulation') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)') match exactly, so occurrence and detection ratings are consistent. The severity rating of 7 corresponds well to 'Reduced service, customers are dissatisfied', appropriate for liner landing surface damage affecting engine performance. Thus, the directly retrieved ratings are applicable without adjustment."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,Liner landing surface damage,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block Subsystem, Cylinder liner assembly, Function: Clearance to crankcase, Failure mode: Liner contact disruption at bottom, Failure cause: Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification, Failure effect: Liner landing surface damage) matches exactly with retrieved data concerning Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and very similar preventive and detective measures. Preventive measures (GASENGDP018 Liner, FEA Simulation, Drawing specification) and extensive detective measures are consistent and even more expanded in the target system, implying at least similar or slightly improved risk. Thus, the retrieved risk ratings of Severity=7, Occurrence=3, and Detection=5 are applicable without adjustment."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Liner landing surface damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data comes from Gas Engine Type 4, which is a very similar product category and subsystem (Engine Block) as the target Gas Engine Type 6. The same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Clearance to crankcase), failure mode (Liner contact disruption at bottom), failure cause (Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)) and failure effect (Liner landing surface damage) match exactly except for the engine type version. Preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved data also fully correspond to those provided for the target system. Since product version differences may introduce some changes in operating parameters and robustness but are unlikely to drastically change failure likelihood or detection capability given identical measures and context, the risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 can be adopted with confidence for Gas Engine Type 6 without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Liner landing surface damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Cylinder liner assembly, Clearance to crankcase, Liner contact disruption at bottom, Assembly process / Design for assembly, Liner landing surface damage) matches exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and preventive/detective measures. The preventive measure '3D Model analysis' and detective measure 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)' are identical. Severity rating is consistent at 7, reflecting 'reduced service, customers are dissatisfied' due to liner landing surface damage. Occurrence rating at 3 indicates low likelihood, supported by effective preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 means high likelihood of detection in subsequent assembly steps consistent with the assembly trial inspection. Since all factors align well with the target system with only a minor product generation difference (Type 6 vs Type 4), it is fully appropriate to apply the exact ratings without adjustment."
"Coolant flow route design (geometry & material), Water jacket design",Engine stop because of engine damage due to inadequate cooling,"EXACT_MATCH - The target failure mode 'Insufficient flow distribution / flow rate' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches exactly in system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect with retrieved data for the same failure mode in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both are in the engine block subsystem with nearly identical preventive and detective measures. Given the strong similarity in product category (gas engines), subsystem, system element, failure cause, and failure effect, and that preventive/detective measures are identical, the retrieved risk ratings are fully applicable without need for adjustment."
Coolant system pressure too low or unstable,Engine stop because of engine damage due to insufficient cooling,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Insufficient flow distribution / flow rate' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' exactly matches with documented failure mode data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both have the same system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('Coolant system pressure too low or unstable' matches 'Coolant system pressure'), and failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage'). Preventive and detective measures listed for the failure cause are identical to those in the retrieved data ('GASENGDP028 Hydraulic and thermal integration', '1d cooling system analysis' for preventive and 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Coolant System)' for detection). The severity rating is consistently 7 due to serious engine damage leading to stop. Occurrence is rated 3 considering the effectiveness of existing preventive measures, which indicate a low likelihood but not negligible. Detection is rated 2 reflecting high likelihood of detection by current functional testing and component inspections. Therefore, risk ratings are directly adopted from the exact match case."
"Coolant flow route design (geometry & material), Water jacket design",Engine stop caused by thermal damage from insufficient heat dissipation,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Cylinder liner assembly, function to provide coolant flow route to liner and cylinder head, failure mode 'Inadequate heat transfer', failure cause 'Coolant flow route design (geometry & material), Water jacket design') perfectly matches retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause and failure effect context. Although the engine type differs numerically (6 vs 4), the functional context and failure scenario are essentially identical within the same product family of gas engines. The preventive measures and detective measures listed exactly correspond to those in the retrieved data. Thus, occurrence and detection ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are fully applicable without adjustment. The severity rating for the failure effect 'Engine stop because of engine damage' is consistently rated 7 in the retrieved data, which fits the impact described. No contradictory information or differences in measures effectiveness arise, so ratings are fully transferable."
Coolant aging,Engine stop caused by thermal damage from decreased coolant effectiveness,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system parameters (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Cylinder liner assembly, function and failure mode 'Inadequate heat transfer' caused by 'Coolant aging', with failure effect being engine stop due to thermal damage) directly match a retrieved failure mode (ID 36) for 'Inadequate heat transfer' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Engine Block' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure cause 'Coolant aging' and preventive/detective measures ('GASENGDP018 Liner', 'TA Coolant Maintenance', 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)') align exactly with those in the retrieved data. Impact severity is consistent as engine stop from thermal damage corresponds to a severity rating of 7. Occurrence rating of 2 for 'Coolant aging' with these preventive measures and detection rating of 2 with the given inspection method are validated by the retrieved context. Therefore, ratings are reused exactly, ensuring consistency and reflecting current measures. No adaptation needed as similarity is exact despite the engine version difference which is minor within the same product category and subsystem context."
"Wrong coolant maintenance (contamination, incorrect fluid composition)",Engine thermal damage and subsequent engine stop,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar failure mode 'Inadequate heat transfer' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' within 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', matching the 'Provide coolant flow route to liner and cylinder head' function and the same failure cause 'Wrong coolant maintenance' with identical preventive measure 'TA Coolant Management' and detective measure 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)'. Both retrieved data and target context are from the Gas Engine product category and same subsystem context with only a slight product generation upgrade (Type 4 to Type 6) which does not materially affect failure mode impact or measure effectiveness. Severity rating is consistent for the effect of 'Engine thermal damage and subsequent engine stop' given in the retrieved data as 7, reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and service interruption but not regulatory violation. Occurrence rating of 1 reflects the high effectiveness of the preventive TA Coolant Management measure in eliminating the cause 'Wrong coolant maintenance'. Detection rating of 2 matches the strong detection capability of Field Validation (Component Inspection) to catch wrong coolant maintenance issues pre-delivery. Therefore, the exact retrieved ratings are suitable and consistent with the current preventive and detective measures."
Temperature of coolant too high beyond design limits,Engine thermal damage leading to engine stop,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (coolant flow and heat transfer), failure mode ('Inadequate heat transfer'), failure cause ('Temperature of coolant too high'), and failure effect ('Engine thermal damage leading to engine stop'). The preventive measures and detective measures mentioned are the same or very similar ('FEA Simulation', 'CFD Waterjacket', 'GASENGDP028 Hydraulic and thermal integration', 'Engine cooling configuration' and 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', 'MCE Thermal Survey'). Therefore, this is a clear similar context scenario with strong alignment. 

Severity is consistent as 7, reflecting a significant impact where engine stops due to thermal damage, aligning with the severity rating scale for reduced service leading to engine stop but not regulatory or extreme financial violation (which would be 9-10).

Occurrence in the retrieved data is rated as 5 (occasional occurrence) given effectiveness of the multiple preventive measures but non-zero chance since thermal conditions can fluctuate. This matches well with the current preventive measures, so no adjustment is needed.

Detection is rated as 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) consistent with use of Field Validation and MCE Thermal Survey providing reasonable detection before customer impact.

Thus, the existing retrieved ratings are fully applicable and are adopted with minor confirmation for the slight variation in engine type 6 environment."
"Coolant flow route design errors, Water jacket design causing trapped gases",Engine thermal damage and stopping due to ineffective cooling,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Insufficient degassing of coolant' within the Cylinder liner assembly of Gas Engine Type 6 closely matches failure modes of 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' and 'Insufficient flow distribution / flow rate' from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same product category, subsystem, system element and functional context of coolant flow management. Both retrieved cases share the same failure cause category related to 'Coolant flow route design' and 'Water jacket design', and similar extensive preventive and detective measures are applied. The difference in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) may slightly affect occurrence due to potential design iteration improvements but preventive measures are equally comprehensive. Severity remains consistent as engine thermal damage leading to engine stop is a severe effect. Detection methods (functional testing, field validation, thermal surveys, endurance runs) are comparable, justifying use of similar detection rating. Therefore, retrieved ratings are adapted with minor justification, maintaining Severity = 7, Occurrence = 5 (occasional despite strong preventive measures), and Detection = 4 (high likelihood of detection via functional tests before customer impact)."
Coolant system pressure issues affecting gas extraction,Engine overheating and damage causing shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient degassing of coolant' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' with failure cause 'Coolant system pressure issues' and failure effect 'Engine overheating and damage causing shutdown' closely aligns with documented failure modes 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' and 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature over time' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both failure modes share the subsystem, system element, similar function (coolant flow/heat transmission), failure cause category (coolant system pressure related), and failure effect (engine overheating and shutdown). Preventive measures like 'GASENGDP028 Hydraulic and thermal integration' and '1d cooling system analysis' and detective measures such as 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)' and 'MCE Functional Testing (Coolant System)' precisely match. The existing data assigns Severity=7 due to engine damage and shutdown, Occurrence=3 reflecting low likelihood given preventive measures, and Detection=2 for high probability of detection with current tests. The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' versus 'Type 4' in reference data, but both belong to the same product category and have similar cooling system design approaches, which justifies using these ratings directly without adjustment. Thus, the ratings are consistent and applicable within the similar context."
Incorrect coolant maintenance or venting procedures,Thermal damage resulting in engine stop,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Insufficient degassing of coolant' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches the failure mode 'Local stagnation of coolant' or 'Air in the coolant circuit system' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Cylinder liner assembly' or close component in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both involve coolant flow and venting issues leading to thermal damage. The retrieved data indicate severity of 7-8 for thermal damage leading to engine stop or significant engine failure, occurrence ratings from 4 to 5 for venting-related causes with similar preventive measures (TA venting practices, coolant maintenance), and detection ratings around 5 (endurance run and field validation inspections focused on low flow or air pockets areas). Since the product generation changed from Type 4 to Type 6, a slight improvement in detection or preventive effectiveness could be assumed due to possible design updates and existing measures. However, the impact on severity remains high due to thermal damage leading to engine stop. The existing preventive measures and detective measures are comprehensive but detection before customer impact is challenging, thus detection rating reflects detection mainly via endurance runs or functional testing rather than certain or immediate detection. Hence, adapting the ratings from context Type 4 to Type 6 conservatively, Severity is rated 8 (aligning with thermal damage and engine stop, customers dissatisfied and engine stop), Occurrence 5 (occasional occurrence despite preventive measures, consistent with venting and maintenance), and Detection 5 (detection achievable only through targeted inspection, endurance runs and quality checks). This approach aligns with the rating schema and system similarity definitions while respecting preventive/detective measures presence."
"O-Ring design flaws, material aging, or part machining inaccuracies",Oil contamination causing engine shutdown due to lubrication failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Coolant leaks into crankcase over time' with causes 'O-Ring design flaws, material aging, or part machining inaccuracies' and effect 'Oil contamination causing engine shutdown due to lubrication failure' matches closely with the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', same failure mode and causes. The product type and functional context are essentially the same (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4, Engine Block). Preventive and detective measures are similar in scope and complexity. Severity from retrieved data is 5 for 'Oil contamination would lead to engine shutdown,' which corresponds to moderate process disturbance with some customers affected (rated 4-6). Given the end effect causes engine shutdown due to lubrication failure, and oil contamination severity is critical but not regulatory or financial catastrophic (no data suggests higher severity), the severity of 5 is appropriate. Occurrence rating in the retrieved data for O-Ring related causes and machining inaccuracies is 3 (low likelihood) supported by strong preventive controls including O-Ring catalogues and design specs, matching the target system's preventive measures, so occurrence is maintained at 3. Detection rating is 4 in retrieved data, indicating high likelihood detection in subsequent processes like endurance testing and assembly trials, aligning well with the target system's extensive detective measures. Therefore, no major adjustment is needed in detection. Overall, ratings from similar context 'Gas Engine Type 4' apply directly with slight confidence that measures are effective and detection is good. Hence ratings are: Severity 5, Occurrence 3, Detection 4."
"Liner landing design geometry, roughness, tolerance stack up, or machining errors","Leakage to environment, loss of coolant, and potential engine overheating","SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The retrieved data includes FMEA entries for a very similar failure mode ('Coolant leaks through cylinder head-liner interface over time') in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' component within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a Gas Engine Type 4, which closely matches the target context Gas Engine Type 6. The system element, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect align exactly, with only a different engine type iteration (Type 4 vs Type 6) but same product category and functional context. Preventive and detective measures listed for the failure cause 'Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, tolerance, machining errors)' substantially overlap with the target system measures, indicating comparable mitigation controls. 

Severity: The failure effect is 'Leakage to environment, loss of coolant, potential engine overheating'. Retrieved severity rating is 4 for 'Leakage to environment' for this failure mode, reflecting process disturbance with limited to some customer impact but not regulatory violation or high financial damage. This aligns well with the defined severity scale and the described effects.

Occurrence: Retrieved occurrence rating is 3 (low likelihood) acknowledging the multiple existing preventive measures such as detailed design tolerance guidelines, FEA simulation, 3D MBS analysis, liner distortion software analysis, and strict drawing specifications. Given the preventive measures in the target system are equally comprehensive, occurrence aligns to 3.

Detection: The retrieved detection rating is 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) reflecting that while multiple MCE functional tests and field validations exist (component inspection, oil analysis, performance measurement, etc.), the failure is not always detected prior to delivery but can be found by planned inspection/tests. Since the target system has similar detective methods, detection rating remains consistent at 5.

No significant context differences like different customer sensitivity or less effective measures are identified. Therefore, the retrieved ratings apply with confidence to the Gas Engine Type 6 target system.

"Coolant flow route design (geometry & material), water jacket design, liner design, coolant system pressure, or high coolant temperature",Engine stop because of engine damage due to thermal stresses,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' on 'Cylinder liner assembly' in 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved data references the same failure mode, system element, subsystem, and function but from 'Gas Engine Type 4', which is in the same product category (gas engines) and a very similar functional and structural context. Preventive and detective measures listed in the target are nearly identical or overlapping with those in the retrieved context, indicating similar control strategies and expected risks. Severity rating of 7 (engine stop/engine damage) is consistent with the highly critical nature of this failure in both contexts. Occurrence ratings in retrieved data vary for failure causes between 3 and 5 reflecting occasional to low likelihood with existing preventive measures, which aligns with the extensive preventive measures in the target. Detection ratings mostly range 2 to 5 reflecting fairly good detection by field validation and MCE functional testing. No safety or regulatory violations indicate severity below 9. Given the close similarity and comparable measures, the retrieved ratings are applicable with minimal adjustment, confirming: Severity=7, Occurrence=5 (taking upper range for worst failure cause moderate likelihood), Detection=4 (high likelihood of detection in functional testing and surveys)."
Same as immediate heat transfer failure but occurring gradually over time,Progressive engine damage leading eventually to engine shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' but the retrieved data is for 'Gas Engine Type 4'; subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Provide coolant flow to liner and cylinder head), failure mode ('Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature over time'), and failure effect ('Progressive engine damage leading eventually to engine shutdown') match exactly except the engine type version and the failure cause is gradual over time rather than immediate heat transfer failure; preventive and detective measures for both are consistent and comparable. Severity rating of 7 is exact from retrieved data ('Engine stop because of engine damage' severity 7), reflecting reduced service with engine shutdown impact. Occurrence ratings from the retrieved data for relevant causes range from 1 to 5 considering preventive measures; given gradual failure over time (likely less immediate but persistent), maintain occurrence at 4 (occasional occurrence) reflecting moderate likelihood despite multiple preventive measures. Detection ratings in retrieved data range from 2 to 4 (mostly good detection through functional testing and field validation). Given numerous effective detective measures available, detection rating adjusted to 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) for this gradual failure mode. This adjustment considers the similar but newer engine version, similar preventive and detective measures, and the nature of failure by degradation over time."
O-Ring design deficiencies including incorrect sizing or incompatibility with coolant,Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown due to emulsified lubricant,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 cylinder liner assembly sealing coolant jacket with failure mode 'Loss of sealing integrity causing coolant leakage into crankcase over time' due to 'O-Ring design deficiencies'. The retrieved data shows almost exact matches for a Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function, failure mode (coolant leaks into crankcase over time), and failure cause (O-Ring design). Preventive and detective measures are highly similar, involving O-Ring specification/catalogues, design per spec, supplier involvement, leakage and endurance tests. Minor variation in engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) and possible operating conditions suggest risk factors might be slightly adapted but generally consistent. Severity rating from retrieved data for a related failure effect (oil contamination leading to engine shutdown) is 5, logically appropriate given oil contamination leads to engine shutdown but not immediate safety or regulatory violation. Occurrence is rated 3 in the retrieved data reflecting low likelihood due to good preventive controls, which aligns well with the detailed preventive measures listed for the target system. Detection rating in retrieved data is 4 (high likelihood of detection through assembly trial and endurance tests), matching well the listed detective measures in the target. Therefore, severity = 5, occurrence = 3, detection = 4 is assessed as appropriate for the target system after considering close similarity and existing measures. Adjustments are minimal given high similarity and aligned measures."
Cylinder liner or mating part not machined to specification tolerances,Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown due to emulsified lubricant,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Sealing of coolant jacket), failure mode ('Loss of sealing integrity causing coolant leakage into crankcase over time'), failure cause ('Cylinder liner or mating part not machined to specification tolerances') and failure effect ('Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown due to emulsified lubricant'). Matching data was found only from Gas Engine Type 4, which is a similar product but a different engine type within the same product category (gas engines). The subsystem, component, function, failure mode, cause, and effect are highly analogous, only differing by engine version and naming variations. Preventive and detective measures in the retrieved context align closely with those in the target context ('GASENGDP018 Liner, Drawing specification' and comprehensive MCE Functional and Field Validation tests). The severity rating for oil contamination causing engine shutdown was consistently rated as 5 (process disturbance, problems for some customers), which suits the described effect since the effect leads to engine shutdown but is not described as regulatory violation or major financial damage beyond process impact. Occurrence rating retrieved for 'part not machined to spec' cause is 3 (low likelihood) reflecting the effectiveness of liner drawing specifications in preventing the defect. Given the extensive functional and assembly testing and monitoring listed in the detective measures, detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes). The transition from Gas Engine Type 4 to Type 6 may include incremental improvements but not a fundamental change in manufacturing or inspection; hence, the retrieved ratings apply well with no need for adjustment. Therefore, as an SIMILAR_CONTEXT, the retrieved ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 failure mode 'Coolant leaks to through CH-liner interface over time' with failure cause 'Part is not machined to spec' are adopted directly for the target context."
O-Ring aging and degradation reducing elastic sealing properties over lifecycle,Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown due to emulsified lubricant,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Loss of sealing integrity causing coolant leakage into crankcase over time' with cause 'O-Ring aging and degradation' and effect 'Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown due to emulsified lubricant' closely matches retrieved failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 within the Engine Block subsystem, Cylinder liner assembly, with near identical function and failure cause. Retrieved data shows similar failure modes with 'O-Ring aging' cause having occurrence ratings mainly around 2-3 and detection ratings mostly 4-5 with preventive and detective measures very similar ('O-Ring specification catalogues', 'O-Ring calculation', and 'MCE Endurance Testing', 'Field Validation'). The severity rating varies in retrieved data depending on failure effects: for oil contamination leading to engine shutdown the severity is rated at 5 in retrieved data, but here emulsified lubricant causing engine shutdown aligns with a more severe impact. Due to slightly more severe customer impact (engine shutdown from lubricant emulsification), severity is adapted upwards to 7 (consistent with related severe sealing failures causing engine shutdown). Occurrence rating is set to 3, consistent with moderately controlled aging degradation despite preventive measures. Detection rating is set to 4 (high likelihood of detection through daily endurance and field inspections), aligning with retrieved context but allowing that the leak develops slowly over lifecycle and detection is mainly via endurance and field validation. This reflects a balanced adaptation of the retrieved ratings to the target Gas Engine Type 6 context with similar subsystem and failure characteristics but slightly higher severity due to the critical effect on engine operation."
Liner landing surface design flaws such as improper geometry or surface roughness,Coolant leakage into environment causing environmental contamination and potential regulatory non-compliance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Coolant leakage through cylinder head (CH)-liner interface over time' in Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Cylinder liner assembly matches well the failure mode 'Coolant leaks to through CH-liner interface over time' in Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Both share the same product category (gas engines) and functional context. Preventive measures listed are effectively identical or highly similar, including design guidelines, FEA simulations, and tolerance stack-ups. Detective measures also substantially overlap, including various MCE functional tests and field validations. Given this close alignment, the existing ratings can be adapted with minimal change. The severity rating for 'Coolant leakage into environment causing environmental contamination and regulatory non-compliance' in Gas Engine Type 4 context is 4, indicating a moderate process disturbance but not severe regulatory violation; however, environmental contamination with regulatory non-compliance potentially suggests higher impact. But since the retrieved severity is 4 and the failure effect wording matches similarly, we keep severity = 4 for consistency with prior cases. Occurrence rating of 3 is retained because preventive measures are thorough and mitigative, indicating low likelihood of failure cause (liner landing design flaws), consistent with retrieved data. Detection rating is taken as 5, which matches detection only via targeted inspection (MCE functional testing, assembly tests), reflecting that no 100% certain detection process exists before delivery but possible with focused inspections. Overall, the risk ratings are consistent with those from a very closely related Gas Engine Type 4 system, warranting a SIMILAR_CONTEXT categorization with minimal adjustment."
Incorrect geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specification in interface areas,Coolant leakage into environment causing environmental contamination and potential regulatory non-compliance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode of coolant leakage through the cylinder head-liner interface over time, failure cause of incorrect geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specification, and failure effect of environmental contamination and potential regulatory non-compliance. Retrieved data shows a closely matching scenario in 'Gas Engine Type 4' on the same component (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Sealing of coolant jacket), failure mode (Coolant leaks through CH-liner interface over time), and failure cause (Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification). Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical. The failure effect severity in retrieved data is rated 4 for 'Leakage to environment' which aligns with process disturbance and environmental impact but does not explicitly mention regulatory non-compliance; however, target effect specifies regulatory non-compliance which elevates the severity rating. Therefore, severity is increased compared to the retrieved 4 to 9 to align with risk rating definitions (9-10 for regulation violation and financial damage). Occurrence remains consistent at 3 because preventive measures and failure cause are the same and effective. Detection remains at 5 consistent with targeted inspection detection measures detailed in retrieved data. Overall, the minor but crucial difference in failure effect nature justifies a severity elevation from 4 to 9; occurrence and detection ratings are adopted from the retrieved context with confirmation they fit the existing measures and detection capabilities."
Cylinder liner or associated parts not machined to required specifications,Coolant leakage into environment causing environmental contamination and potential regulatory non-compliance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' while retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same product category and subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), same function (Sealing of coolant jacket), same failure mode ('Coolant leakage through cylinder head-liner interface over time') and failure cause ('Part is not machined to spec'). The retrieved failure mode with ID 39 ('Coolant leaks to through CH-liner interface over time') matches the function, failure mode and failure cause very closely. Preventive measures ('GASENGDP018 Liner, Drawing specification') and detective measures are identical or equivalent to the target. Severity rating from retrieved data is 4 (Leakage to environment), but target failure effect explicitly states environmental contamination and potential regulatory non-compliance which is more serious, warranting an increase in severity to 9 as it involves regulatory violation. Occurrence rating is 3 in retrieved data for 'Part is not machined to spec', which aligns with the existing preventive measures and their effectiveness; this rating remains unchanged. Detection rating varies between 4 and 5 in the retrieved data depending on failure mode context; given the extensive functional and field testing already in place (listed in target), detection is relatively effective but not certain before delivery; therefore detection rating is set at 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes). This combination reflects the adapted severity due to regulatory impact, consistent occurrence with maintained preventive measures efficiency, and effective detection capability from comprehensive testing. Thus, the final ratings are Severity 9, Occurrence 3, and Detection 4."
"Inadequate coolant flow route design, including geometry and material selection","Coolant leakage into combustion chamber, causing loss of cooling effectiveness and potential overheating","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Insufficient containment of combustion gases' with failure cause 'Inadequate coolant flow route design, including geometry and material selection' is closely related to the retrieved failure mode 'Not enough containment of combustion gases' and its cause 'Coolant flow route design (geometry & material) | Water jacket design' from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same product category and subsystem. Preventive and detective measures match tightly with minor naming differences, confirming the applicability of existing ratings. Severity is consistent due to identical failure effects (coolant leakage into combustion chamber, overheating potential) rated as 8. Occurrence rating in Gas Engine Type 4 is 5 (occasional), considering the complex coolant flow design and simulation prevention measures, which fits the provided measures here. Detection ratings match as 5 (detection via field validation and functional thermal tests) per the MCE testing and field inspections described, consistent with the provided detective measures. No significant operational environment or measure effectiveness differences justify rating adjustments. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are adopted directly as a SIMILAR_CONTEXT with confirmation of consistency in failure impact and controls."
Cylinder liner design faults including geometry inaccuracies or unsuitable material properties,"Coolant intrusion into combustion chamber, resulting in compromised combustion and engine performance","EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Insufficient containment of combustion gases' with the failure cause 'Cylinder liner design faults including geometry inaccuracies or unsuitable material properties' and the failure effect 'Coolant intrusion into combustion chamber, resulting in compromised combustion and engine performance' perfectly matches a documented failure mode 'Not enough containment of combustion gases' from 'Cylinder liner assembly', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure cause 'Liner design (geometry, material etc.)' matches exactly, preventive and detective measures match sets specified in the retrieved data. The failure effect 'Coolant leakage into combustion chamber' has a severity rating of 8 in that context. Occurrence and detection ratings are directly retrieved from the matching failure cause and mode combination with preventive and detective measures identical to the target context. Therefore, according to the EXACT MATCH criteria, the retrieved ratings are used as is to ensure consistency and accuracy."
Bolted joint design deficiencies causing sealing failure,"Combustion gases escaping the combustion chamber, causing efficiency loss and emissions increase","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode of 'Leakage of combustion gases' caused by 'Bolted joint design deficiencies causing sealing failure' in the Cylinder liner assembly of the Engine Block subsystem. Retrieved data shows multiple failure modes related to sealing degradation or leakage due to bolted joint design in Gas Engine Type 4's Engine Block subsystem, particularly for 'Degradation of sealing over time' and similar leakage failure modes with bolted joint design causes. These data are from a very close functional context (Engine Block, sealing function) and same product category (Gas Engines) but different product generation/type (Type 4 vs Type 6). Existing preventive and detective measures are similar or identical to those described in the retrieved data, indicating similar effectiveness. Severity must be adapted because the failure effect involves leakage of combustion gases causing efficiency loss and emissions increase. Higher risk consequences for combustion gas leakage compared to oil or mixture leakage justify higher severity than typical oil leak (which ranges around 4-7 or 9-10 depending on effect). Combustion gas escaping leads to emission increases (regulatory issue) and efficiency losses, which can cause customer dissatisfaction and possible regulatory violation if emissions exceed limits. Therefore, severity is rated at the upper range (8) reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and regulatory impact but below direct catastrophic failure levels (9-10). Occurrence rating from retrieved data for 'Bolted joint design' as failure cause is generally 3 (low likelihood) to 4 (occasional) depending on test methods and complexity; given similar measures and simulation techniques in place, occurrence is kept at 3 (low likelihood) reflecting good preventive controls but realistic failure potential. Detection is rated 3 reflecting high likelihood of detection due to robust leakage tests, assembly tests, preload measurement and MCE testbench methods. This aligns with retrieved detection ratings (mostly 3 for this failure cause with similar measures). Hence, occurrence and detection ratings are adopted closely with slight contextual confirmation, and severity is adjusted upward analytically due to the direct combustion gas leakage impact in the Cylinder liner assembly. This approach follows SIMILAR_CONTEXT guidelines with analytical adaptation for severity while maintaining consistency for occurrence and detection with closely matched data."
Cylinder liner design flaws including geometry and material weaknesses,Combustion gas leakage impairing engine efficiency and increasing pollutant formation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Cylinder liner assembly in Engine Block subsystem) and the retrieved data pertains to Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Although the engine types differ (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category, component, and failure scenario are highly similar. Preventive and detective measures described in the retrieved data match exactly with the target's measures. Therefore, the retrieved occurrence and detection ratings are applicable with minimal adjustment. Severity rating for 'Combustion gas leakage impairing engine efficiency and increasing pollutant formation' is given as 8, consistent with customer dissatisfaction and reduced service levels. The occurrence rating of 3 reflects low likelihood due to extensive preventive measures (multiple FEA simulations, material characterization, and CFD analyses). The detection rating of 4 reflects a high likelihood of detecting failure in functional testing, assembly tests, and field validation before customer impact. Slight confidence difference due to system improvements in Type 6 is minor, so ratings are aligned to retrieved values."
Gasket design inadequacies affecting the seal integrity between liner and cylinder head,Leakage of combustion gases potentially causing reduced power output and increased emissions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly' with failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' caused by 'Gasket design inadequacies'. Retrieved data shows very similar contexts in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, failure mode ('Leakage of combustion gases' or similar gasket-related gas leakage failure modes), same failure cause ('Gasket design'), and similar failure effect (combustion gas leakage leading to reduced power and increased emissions). Preventive and detective measures are closely aligned between target and retrieved context (e.g., gasket design guidelines/specification and MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation). Thus, this is a similar context scenario between a very closely related engine product type and identical functional conditions. 

Severity: The retrieved severity rating for combustion gas leakage due to gasket issues is consistently rated as 8, indicating reduced service and customer dissatisfaction with emission and power loss impact. This aligns with the failure effect described.
Occurrence: The retrieved occurrence rating for 'Gasket design' failure cause in this failure mode with existing measures is 2 (Unlikely), reflecting effective preventive measures like gasket design guidelines and specification.
Detection: The retrievals use detection rating of 4 for this cause/mode with the detective methods listed, implying a high likelihood of detecting the failure cause through component inspections and performance monitoring prior to customer impact.

No exact product match but high similarity with minimal differences; ratings adjusted minimally to keep consistency and reflect reliable measures in place."
Incorrect or inadequate maintenance procedures leading to loosening or damage of sealing components,Loss of combustion gas containment causing engine performance drop and higher emissions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly', which is the same system element and failure mode as found in the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The retrieved data includes a very closely matching failure mode and effect in the same subsystem and system element, with similar preventive and detective measures, differing only in engine version. Given the similarity in product category (gas engines), subsystem, and failure mode/cause/effect, the retrieved ratings for Type 4 can be adapted with slight considerations for potentially enhanced maintenance or design in Type 6, but no substantial difference in risk drivers was observed. Thus, the severity rating remains consistent at 8 due to the impact on combustion gas containment causing performance drop and higher emissions. Occurrence for the failure cause 'Incorrect or inadequate maintenance procedures leading to loosening or damage of sealing components' is analogous to the 'Wrong maintenance' cause with preventive maintenance and inspections applied, rated at 1 in type 4. Detection rating is aligned with existing detective measures which include multiple functional and field inspections, consistent with a detection rating of 5. Therefore, the adapted risk ratings for the target system are Severity = 8, Occurrence = 1, Detection = 5."
Inadequate coolant flow route design including geometry and material selection of water jacket,Engine shutdown due to thermal damage of engine components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Loss of heat transmission function resulting in elevated liner wall temperature / Thermal overload' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data shows a highly similar failure mode 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' occurring in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' (same product category, very similar system element, function, failure cause, and failure effect). Preventive and detective measures are the same, indicating comparable control effectiveness. Severity for the similar failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage') is consistently rated 7, which matches the target failure effect 'Engine shutdown due to thermal damage of engine components.' Occurrence ratings for the same failure cause and preventive measures are 5, and detection ratings with the given detective measures are 4, reflecting moderate detection likelihood through planned functional thermal tests. Minor possible adjustments due to potential improvements or differences in Gas Engine Type 6 are not indicated by the data; thus, ratings are adopted as-is for consistency and reliability."
Insufficient coolant system pressure leading to reduced thermal fluid flow,Engine stop caused by progressive overheating and material degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and retrieved data refer to highly similar systems within the same product category (gas engines) and same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Transmit heat to water jacket), with nearly matched failure mode ('Loss of heat transmission function causing sustained high liner wall temperature over operating time' aligns well with 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature over time') and identical failure cause ('Insufficient coolant system pressure' closely matches 'Coolant system pressure'). Existing preventive and detective measures are highly similar or identical ('GASENGDP028 Hydraulic and thermal integration', '1d cooling system analysis', 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Coolant System)'). The retrieved ratings for this failure cause and mode in Gas Engine Type 4 are: Severity=7 (engine stop due to overheating and damage), Occurrence=3 (low likelihood with current preventive measures), Detection=2 (certain detection through field inspection and coolant system functional test). Given high similarity but slightly more advanced engine type possibly with comparable robustness of measures, ratings can be adopted directly without adjustment after verification, as the measures and failure effect severity would closely align. Thus, ratings are consistent and applicable for target context."
Decreased thermal transport capacity from aged or chemically degraded coolant,Engine damage resulting in operational interruption or stoppage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with the failure mode 'Functional limitation of heat transmission efficiency due to coolant aging or degradation' in the Cylinder liner assembly, Engine Block subsystem, affecting the 'Transmit heat to water jacket' function. Retrieved data shows closely matching failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 for the Cylinder liner assembly with similar functions and failure effects ('Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature over time' and 'Inadequate heat transfer'), caused by 'Coolant aging' with the same preventive measures ('GASENGDP018 Liner', 'TA Coolant Maintenance') and detective measure ('Field Validation (Component Inspection)'). The failure effect severity in retrieved data is rated 7 due to engine damage causing operational stoppage, which aligns with the target system failure effect. Occurrence rating for coolant aging with these preventive measures is 2 (unlikely) and detection rating is 2 (certain detection by field inspection). Since the product type differs only by model variant (Type 4 to Type 6) without fundamental functional change or operational environment shift, ratings from Type 4 context are applicable without adjustment. Preventive and detective measure effectiveness is consistent in both contexts. Thus, final ratings are taken from retrieved similar context data for coolant aging causing functional heat transmission limitation."
"Incorrect coolant fill, concentration errors, or contamination reducing heat transfer capability",Engine thermal overload potentially leading to failure and shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', with failure mode involving 'Functional interruption of heat transfer due to improper coolant maintenance or contamination'. The retrieved data covers very similar failure modes in the same component and subsystem but for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure modes 'Inadequate heat transfer' and 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' directly correspond to the function 'Transmit heat to water jacket' and have failure effects of 'Engine stop because of engine damage' with severity rating 7. The failure cause in retrieved data closest to the target cause is 'Wrong coolant maintenance' with preventive measures 'TA Coolant Management' and detective measures including 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', matching closely the target's preventive and detective measures. The occurrence rating for 'Wrong coolant maintenance' is very low (1) in the retrieved data, reflecting strong preventive measures. Detection is rated 2, indicating good detection capability before customer impact. Given the target measures are similar or improved (including 'Coolant maintenance plan' and multiple field validations and inspections), the occurrence and detection ratings remain valid or slightly better. Severity is consistent since the failure effect (engine thermal overload leading to shutdown) is severe but not regulatory violation or direct financial loss beyond operational downtime, rated as 7 in retrieved data. Therefore, adapting retrieved ratings to Type 6 engine context with similar criticality and existing preventive/detective measures leads to: Severity 7, Occurrence 1 (low likelihood due to strong maintenance measures), Detection 2 (high detection likelihood from field validation and tests)."
Coolant bulk temperature operating above specified thermal thresholds,Localized liner overheating causing engine damage and stop,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Thermal fluctuation from coolant temperature exceeding design limits' causing 'Localized liner overheating causing engine damage and stop' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches failure modes 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' and similar variants in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Transmit heat to water jacket), and cause (Coolant temperature too high). Preventive and detective measures are also highly consistent. Differences in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) are considered minor within the same product family, hence base ratings from Type 4 data are adapted with reasoning for slight tuning due to possible differences in engine complexity and cooling design maturity. Severity remains the same because the failure effect (engine damage and stop) is a direct match in impact. Occurrence is retained at 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting similar thermal management measures and challenges. Detection remains at 4 (high likelihood of detection) due to existing field validation and thermal survey capabilities. Overall, the risk ratings reflect a similar consequence profile and effectiveness of measures with no strong justification to deviate significantly from the retrieved Type 4 data, ensuring consistency and reliability of the FMEA ratings."
"Liner wall thickness, surface roughness, material thermal conductivity, or dimensional inaccuracies",Elevated liner wall temperature causing premature engine stoppage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, Cylinder Liner Assembly in Engine Block, failure mode 'Functional limitation of heat transmission due to suboptimal liner assembly design'. Retrieved data indicates a very similar failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, system element, function and failure effects related to 'Too less heat transmission / High liner wall temperature' caused partly by 'Liner design (geometry, material etc.)'. Preventive and detective measures are highly overlapping with the target context including similar FEA simulations, thermal and CFD analyses, and extensive functional testing and field validation. Severity rating is consistent as engine stoppage due to elevated liner temperature is the major effect rated 7 in source data. Occurrence rating for liner design cause is 3 based on existing effective preventive measures but not failure proof. Detection rating is 4 reflecting high likelihood of detection through intensive functional and thermal testing before field failure. Given the close match but different engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4), ratings are carried over with slight confidence that preventive and detective measures are similar in effectiveness. Thus, Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 aligns well with the target context."
"Liner design (geometry, material etc.)",Emission regulations are not met,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function ('Provide structural support to APR'), failure mode ('High THC emissions over time'), failure cause ('Liner design (geometry, material etc.)'), and failure effect ('Emission regulations are not met') as retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The preventive and detective measures listed in the target context are also consistent with those in the retrieved data, indicating similar mitigation strategies and detection capabilities. Given the similarity but different engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4), we consider potential minor variations in operating conditions or design evolution but no fundamental change in risk profile. Severity remains high at 9 due to regulatory impact. Occurrence remains low (3) reflecting effective preventive measures like extensive FEA and CFD simulations and material characterization. Detection remains moderate (5), indicating reliance on targeted functional testing and field validation before emissions issues are confirmed. Therefore, retained ratings from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are applicable with confidence for 'Gas Engine Type 6' after analytical verification."
Gasket design,Emission regulations are not met,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'High THC emissions over time' caused by 'Gasket design' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' subsystem. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect in the same product category (gas engines) strongly aligns in context. Preventive and detective measures are essentially the same or very similar. Therefore, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 can be used as a baseline. Minor adjustment consideration: Type 6 might have slightly updated technology but no new measures provided that would significantly alter occurrence or detection. Severity remains the same because emission regulations apply equally. Occurrence and detection remain consistent due to identical measures and failure causes. Hence, we apply the retrieved ratings directly with justification that the newer product likely maintains the same RPN framework as Type 4."
Wrong maintenance,Emission regulations are not met,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 matches perfectly in subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Provide structural support to APR), failure mode (High THC emissions over time), failure cause (Wrong maintenance), and failure effect (Emission regulations are not met). Preventive and detective measures are highly similar, with matching TA Cylinder Head and Power Unit Maintenance for prevention, and extensive MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation for detection. Since the target product is Gas Engine Type 6, a close variant in the same product category with expected similar operating and maintenance conditions, slight contextual adaptations are made. Severity remains at 9 given regulatory impact is consistent across engine types. Occurrence remains at 1 reflecting the strong preventive maintenance measures effectively minimizing occurrence. Detection remains at 5 based on the moderate detection capability described (targeted inspections predominantly) for the failure cause and the failure mode. Thus, retrieved ratings are directly employed without modification but acknowledged as SIMILAR_CONTEXT due to engine model difference."
Deposit build up (oil),Emission regulations are not met,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Cylinder liner assembly), Function (Provide structural support to APR), Failure Mode ('High THC emissions over time'), Failure Cause ('Deposit build up (oil)'), and Failure Effect ('Emission regulations are not met'). Preventive and detective measures are the same as those in the target system. The slight difference in product version (Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product category (Gas Engine) and identical subsystem context supports direct use of existing ratings without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Damage on interface components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is functionally and contextually very similar to multiple retrieved failure cases of 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', including components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover'. Both contexts share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem, similar system elements (structural components supporting engine parts), function, failure mode, failure cause ('Assembly process / Design for assembly'), and failure effect ('Damage on interface components'). Preventive and detective measures are also closely aligned, e.g., involving production/service teams in design and comprehensive MCE testbench tests. 

Severity is consistent at 8 in retrieved data for 'Damage on interface components' due to significant customer dissatisfaction and damage to critical interfaces. Given that 'Cylinder liner assembly' structural failure could give similar impact, Severity = 8 is appropriate.

Occurrence is rated at 5 in retrieved exact cause context (assembly process / design for assembly) with similar strong preventive measures involving cross-disciplinary design teams. No evidence suggests better or worse control in the target, so Occurrence = 5 is appropriate.

Detection rating is 4 in retrieved data reflecting detection by thorough MCE testbenches, assembly tests, inspections, and monitoring (oil, vibration, coolant). The target system uses equivalent detective measures; thus Detection = 4 fits.

Therefore, the FMEA risk ratings from the similar context are confidently adapted to the target 'Cylinder liner assembly' without downward or upward adjustment."
Crankcase design affecting liner assembly support,Loosening of bolts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support (loss of function)' with failure cause 'Crankcase design affecting liner assembly support' and failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is very close but not exact compared to retrieved data. The retrieved exact match case is 'Insufficient structural support' in 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same failure cause 'Crankcase design' and the identical failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' both related to structural support and bolt loosening. Both are in the same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem (Engine Block), and closely functionally related components supporting structural loads and bolted interfaces. However, the component differs slightly (Cylinder liner assembly vs Rear end cover). Given the similarity in function (structural support), failure cause, preventive measures (robust design per specifications, MBS, FEA, design tolerance guidelines), and detective measures (leakage test, endurance run, assembly test, MCE testbench tests), we adapt the retrieved risk ratings accordingly for the Cylinder liner assembly context. 

Severity: The retrieved severity for loosening of bolts due to insufficient structural support in a similar context is 8, reflecting significant loss of stiffness and damage to interface components causing operational impact and customer dissatisfaction. This aligns well with the target failure effect impact and is consistent with the severity rating definition.

Occurrence: In the retrieved similar case, the occurrence rating for 'Crankcase design' cause is 3 (low likelihood) reflecting effective preventive measures like MBS, FEA, tolerance stack analysis, etc. The preventive measures listed for the target system are very similar and comprehensive, so we maintain Occurrence at 3.

Detection: The retrieved detection rating for this failure cause and mode is 4, indicating high likelihood of detection during manufacturing and test phases (assembly test, leakage test, MCE testbench overload, performance, start/stop tests). The target system uses nearly identical detective measures, so we assign detection rating 4 as well."
Front/End cover design,Damage on interface components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support (loss of function)' with failure cause 'Front/End cover design' and failure effect 'Damage on interface components' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches the retrieved failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both share the same system element identity (structural support related to engine block components), same failure mode and failure cause, and same failure effect with high impact on interface components. Preventive and detective measures are very similar, involving design participation, FEA, simulations, tolerances, and testbench inspections. The product types are similar gas engine types serving analogous functions in the engine block subsystem. Given this similarity, the existing ratings are highly applicable. Minor contextual adjustment is minimal because structural support failure in cylinder liner assembly likely affects interface components similarly. Therefore, adopted ratings are Severity=8 (damage on interface components), Occurrence=3 (occasional occurrence with strong design controls and simulations reducing frequency), Detection=4 (high likelihood of detection before delivery via extensive testbench and inspection measures)."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,Lack of stiffness (excessive movement),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support (loss of function)' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' Engine Block matches exactly the failure mode and effect context seen in 'Gas Engine Type 4' Engine Block subsystem components (e.g. Front end housing and Rear end cover) with the same failure mode, cause ('Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'), and effect ('Lack of stiffness (excessive movement)'). Both systems belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem (Engine Block), with similar functional roles. Preventive and detective measures are highly analogous, including design and tolerance specifications, tolerance stackup, involvement of controls/service teams, and extensive MCE testbench procedures. Existing data scores occurrence as 3 (low likelihood due to robust preventive controls) and detection as 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent testing stages). Severity for 'Lack of stiffness (excessive movement)' is consistently rated 8 due to significant impact on structural integrity and customer dissatisfaction from reduced system performance. Given the strong alignment and comparable controls and effects, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Pipe design affecting mounting and support,Loosening of bolts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' with failure cause 'Pipe design' and failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' on the 'Cylinder liner assembly' in the 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for a similar subsystem and function (Engine Block providing structural support). Although the exact component differs (Cylinder liner assembly vs Front end housing or Rear end cover), the functional context and failure effect severity are consistent. Preventive and detective measures are very similar or identical, allowing reliable transfer of ratings. Minor adjustment is made considering the critical nature of bolt loosening in cylinder liner assembly (critical for engine integrity), but since severity ratings for 'Loosening of bolts' across retrieved data is consistently 8, this is retained. Occurrence rating of 3 and detection rating of 4 from the retrieved 'Pipe design' cause data are applicable, reflecting effective preventive design measures and moderately good detection via test benches and preload measurements. Thus, risk ratings are adapted from the similar context data without major modification."
Bolted joint design flaws leading to insufficient sealing force or uneven load distribution,"Combustion gas escapes from the combustion chamber leading to decreased engine efficiency, increased emissions, and potential engine performance degradation","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' in the Cylinder liner assembly with failure cause being bolted joint design flaws causing insufficient sealing force or uneven load distribution. Retrieved data show multiple failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 within Engine Block subsystem, involving bolted joint design related failures causing leakage modes (oil/mixture or gas leakage) or sealing degradation. While the exact failure mode is not found, these retrieved failure modes share the same system element (engine block subsystem) and similar failure cause (bolted joint design issues), and similar sealing leakage failure effects affecting engine combustion efficiency and emissions. However, Type 6 gas engine and cylinder liner assembly for combustion gas leakage is a higher consequence failure affecting engine performance and emissions compliance, likely more severe than oil leakage modes or crankcase gas leakage. Preventive measures and detection approaches are similar (VDI 2230 calculations, FEA simulation, ultrasonic bolt measurement, functional testing, leakage tests, preload measurements), indicating comparable occurrence and detection probability framework but with notable difference in failure effect severity and impact on regulations/emissions. Hence, it is appropriate to adapt ratings from related failure modes with analytic adjustment for severity due to higher regulation and engine performance impact, and adjusted detection rating reflecting strong testing and inspection measures available. Occurrence is kept aligned with Type 4 bolted joint design flaws with similar preventive controls. Therefore, severity is rated at 9 reflecting high impact and regulation violation risk, occurrence at 5 consistent with moderate occurrence under good preventive controls, and detection at 3 showing high likelihood of detection through existing rigorous test and inspection methods before customer delivery."
Assembly process errors or inadequate design for assembly causing improper gasket seating or damage,"Combustion gas leakage from the combustion chamber, potentially causing local overheating and component damage","EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Engine Block' subsystem for Gas Engine Type 4, which closely matches the target context 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The function, failure mode, failure cause (assembly process / design for assembly causing improper gasket seating or damage), and failure effect (combustion gas leakage causing overheating and damage) align well. Preventive measure '3D Model analysis' and detective measure 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)' also match perfectly. Therefore, existing risk ratings can be directly adopted and considered valid for the target system with consistent reasoning."
Liner design issues such as incorrect geometry or unsuitable material properties causing sealing surface deformation,"Escape of combustion gases from chamber, leading to failure to meet emission standards and efficiency loss","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data includes a very close match from a 'Gas Engine Type 4' at the exact subsystem, system element, function, failure mode and failure cause level though from a prior engine generation. Since measures and design intents are very similar and the product category (industrial gas engines) and context are almost identical, this constitutes a SIMILAR_CONTEXT scenario. The retrieved severity rating for the failure effect 'Escape of combustion gases from chamber, leading to emission noncompliance and efficiency loss' is 8, consistent with customer dissatisfaction due to regulatory violation risk, which fits well the description and should be maintained. The occurrence rating for the failure cause 'Liner design issues such as geometry or material causing deformation' has been rated as 3 (low likelihood) in the Gas Engine Type 4 context, supported by extensive robust FEA simulations, material characterization and validations listed in preventive measures. Given the similar and thorough set of preventive measures in the target system, the occurrence rating remains applicable without adjustment. The detection rating is 4, which corresponds to high likelihood of detection by functional and performance testing (thermal surveys, blow-by measurements, functional tests, and validation runs) before customer delivery. This also aligns well with the detective measures in the target system, so this rating is retained. Hence, the risk ratings from the very close prior data are analytically adapted and directly applied with consistency for the target system."
Gasket design deficiencies such as inappropriate material selection or inadequate compression characteristics,"Increased blow-by gases and emissions, potential damage to adjacent components and regulatory non-compliance","EXACT MATCH: The failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' with failure cause 'Gasket design deficiencies such as inappropriate material selection or inadequate compression characteristics' and failure effect 'Increased blow-by gases and emissions, potential damage to adjacent components and regulatory non-compliance' matches exactly to a documented failure mode in 'Gas Engine Type 4' Cylinder liner assembly, Engine Block subsystem with the same function and similar failure cause and effect. Preventive measures ('Gasket design guidelines', 'Gasket specification') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation (Performance monitoring)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', 'Assembly test (Fujifilm)') are consistent with retrieved data. Severity aligns with regulatory non-compliance and emissions impact, justifying a high severity score. Occurrence is based on existing preventive measures reducing likelihood. Detection is relatively strong due to multiple functional and performance tests but not guaranteed. Hence, the retrieved ratings for occurrence and detection for the cause 'Gasket design' (occurrence 2 and detection 4) and severity (severity 8) from the Gas Engine Type 4 context are directly applicable and consistent with the target Gas Engine Type 6 system context."
Incorrect or neglected maintenance causing degradation or damage to sealing surfaces,Combustion gas leakage with potential engine performance loss and higher emissions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a 'Leakage of combustion gases' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved data includes an exact failure mode and element match for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with similar preventive and detective measures. The failure effect severity is consistently rated '8' due to combustion gas leakage impacting engine performance and emissions, setting a clear severity benchmark. The failure cause 'Incorrect or neglected maintenance' corresponds closely to 'Wrong maintenance' in retrieved data with occurrence rated as '1' (rare due to strong maintenance measures) but detection rated as '5' (detectable only by targeted inspection like component inspection and field validation). Since maintenance schedules and service involvement measures are consistent across types and gas engines are functionally similar, the occurrence and detection ratings apply directly without adjustment. Severity remains '8' per official impact rating on combustion gas leakage. Therefore, the exact retrieved severity, occurrence, and detection ratings for this failure mode and cause apply appropriately with analytical confirmation based on similar product category, subsystem, element, and function."
Incorrect geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specifications leading to sealing gaps,Failure to comply with emission regulations due to increased unburned hydrocarbons in exhaust,"EXACT_MATCH: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with a Cylinder liner assembly in the Engine Block subsystem, failure mode 'High THC emissions over time' caused by 'Incorrect geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specifications'. Retrieved data shows an exact match for the failure mode and failure cause in Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem and system element, same function, failure cause, measures, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures align closely with the target. Severity rating for the failure effect 'Violation of emission regulations' is consistently rated 9. Occurrence for geometry tolerance issues is rated 3 due to effective preventive controls (GASENGDP018 Liner, FEA Simulation, Drawing specification). Detection rating is 5 considering the comprehensive functional and component inspection tests (e.g., MCE Functional Testing, Assembly tests, Field Validation) but detection is only via targeted inspections, not obvious before delivery. Given strong similarity and measure equivalency, these ratings are directly applicable without adjustment for the Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Suboptimal liner design in terms of geometry or material causing sealing deterioration,Elevated total hydrocarbons emissions impairing environmental compliance and engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 6, Cylinder liner assembly, Engine Block subsystem, with failure mode 'High THC emissions over time' caused by 'Suboptimal liner design (geometry or material)' leading to elevated THC emissions, impairing regulatory compliance and engine performance. Retrieved data includes exact matches of failure mode, system element, subsystem, and function but in Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category - gas engines - with highly similar design and operating conditions). The failure cause 'Liner design (geometry, material etc.)' in the failure mode 'High THC emissions over time' is found with detailed preventive and detective measures closely matching the target context measures. The failure effect 'Emission regulations are not met' has a severity rating of 9, indicating regulatory violation as in the target context. Thus, an exact rating transfer is justified with minor consideration for system maturity differences between Type 4 and Type 6. Preventive and detective measures are robust and detailed, justifying a low occurrence (3) and moderate detection rating (5) due to necessity of targeted inspections and field validations. Therefore, use ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 with confidence, no adjustments are needed given the strong alignment of preventive/detective measures and failure effect impact."
APR (Air/fuel ratio and combustion parameter) design leading to incomplete combustion influenced by sealing defects,"Increase in unburnt hydrocarbons emitted, negatively affecting emissions standards compliance","EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with the retrieved data for 'High THC emissions over time' failure mode in 'Cylinder liner assembly' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, very close to Type 6, both in the same product category and with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause (APR design), and failure effect (high THC emissions violating emission standards). Preventive measures and detective measures match well with those provided. Therefore, risk ratings from this retrieved data can be directly used with confidence."
Gasket design not maintaining proper seal under operating conditions causing leakage,"Unburned hydrocarbon emissions rise, resulting in non-compliance with emissions standards","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode 'High THC emissions over time' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' corresponds closely with data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category and subsystem with matching system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The failure cause 'Gasket design not maintaining proper seal under operating conditions causing leakage' and existing preventive/detective measures align well. However, slight adaptation is needed for potential variations in engine type (Type 6 versus Type 4) likely reflecting incremental design or operational improvements, which may reduce occurrence somewhat but maintain similar detection capabilities due to the comprehensive testing measures. The severity rating remains at 9, as emission non-compliance has comparable regulatory and financial impact across engine types. Occurrence rating is adapted from 2 to 2 reflecting existing well-established gasket design guidelines and specifications indicating low likelihood. Detection remains at 5 due to similar performance and component inspection testing methods used, reflecting detection through targeted inspections rather than certain or high likelihood detection before customer delivery."
Wrong maintenance causing gasket or liner damage and subsequent sealing deterioration,Progressive increase of emissions failing regulatory thresholds over engine life,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT since the retrieved data references the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Cylinder liner assembly), Function (Sealing between cylinder gasket and liner), Failure Mode ('High THC emissions over time'), and Failure Cause ('Wrong maintenance'). The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, while the target is Gas Engine Type 6, which may have similar engineering principles and preventive/detective measures but potentially different operating conditions and regulatory impacts. The preventive measures ('TA Cylinder Head Maintenance' and 'TA Power Unit Maintenance') and detective measures (various MCE Functional Testings and Field Validation inspections/tests) are the same in both contexts. Therefore, the occurrence and detection ratings from Type 4 apply directly. Severity rating must consider the failure effect of progressive emission increase failing regulatory thresholds, which has a high impact consistent with retrieved data severity rating of 9. Given the failure effect is regulatory violation with financial and compliance impact, the severity rating remains 9. Occurrence rating is very low (1) due to effective preventive measures against maintenance errors listed and consistent with retrieved data. Detection rating is moderate (5) since detection relies on targeted inspections and performance measurements after maintenance or during operation, consistent with retrieved data. Hence, Severity=9, Occurrence=1, Detection=5."
Design or tolerance stack-up issues in liner landing area creating non-uniform contact surfaces,"Local sealing failure causing gas leakage, potential liner cracking, and engine shutdown","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Cylinder liner assembly, with failure mode 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner' caused by design or tolerance stack-up issues in the liner landing area, resulting in local sealing failure, gas leakage, potential liner cracking, and engine shutdown. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 shows the same failure mode, system element, subsystem, and very similar failure cause (geometry/tolerance/design issues in liner landing area with non-uniform contact surfaces). The failure effect severity aligns with local sealing failure, gas leakage, and engine shutdown. Although the retrieved data is from Type 4 (different but closely related product in same category, gas engines), existing preventive and detective measures are similar or the same in nature and scope. Therefore, ratings can be adapted from Gas Engine Type 4 data with reasoning below. 

Severity (S): Retrieved severity for engine shutdown due to liner crack or combustion gas leakage in very similar failure modes is rated 7 (engine shutdown due to liner crack) or 8 (combustion gas leakage). Given the severe consequence of engine shutdown, local sealing failure, and potential liner crack explicitly stated in target, severity is rated as 7, consistent with retrieved similar failure modes.

Occurrence (O): Preventive measures include thorough design guidelines, tolerance stack-up analysis, extensive simulation (FEA, MBS), liner distortion analysis, and design controls reflected in Type 4 data for similar causes with occurrence rated consistently at 3 (low likelihood). Given similarity in prevention and tolerance controls in target, occurrence rating 3 is justified.

Detection (D): Detective measures in target and retrieved data are extensive, including component inspection (MCE Functional Testing), field validation, oil analysis, performance measurements, assembly tests (Fujifilm films), and blow-by differential pressure monitoring. Detection ratings for similar failure causes in retrieved data are typically 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes). Since detection methods are well-aligned and comprehensive in target, detection rating of 4 is appropriate.

Summary: Severity 7 reflects serious engine shutdown consequence; Occurrence 3 is due to strong preventive measures for design/tolerance issues; Detection 4 is based on comprehensive inspection and field validation measures typical for this failure mode.

These ratings maintain internal consistency and conform with rating objectives and definitions for this product and failure scenario."
Improper bolted joint design resulting in insufficient clamp force or uneven load distribution,Loss of sealing leading to combustion gas leakage and possible component damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on the failure mode, failure cause, system element, subsystem, and preventive/detective measures matching the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner' caused by 'Bolted joint design'. The similarity is strong because the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), failure mode, failure cause, and preventive/detective measures are the same except for engine model type (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4). No substantial differences in operating environment or functional impact found that would justify adjustment. Severity rating is consistent with the failure effect of combustion gas leakage and possible engine shutdown due to liner crack. Occurrence and detection ratings align with the preventive measures (GASENGDP049 Bolted joint, FEA Simulation) and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation, Assembly test (Fujifilm)) respectively."
Parts not machined to specification resulting in dimensional mismatches,Leak paths created causing loss of combustion pressure and gas leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', function 'Sealing between cylinder gasket and liner', failure mode 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner', failure cause 'Parts not machined to specification resulting in dimensional mismatches', failure effect 'Leak paths causing loss of combustion pressure and gas leakage'. Existing preventive and detective measures match closely those in retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data for very similar failure mode 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner' and cause 'Part is not machined to spec'. The functional context, system element, and failure effect severity (combustion gas leakage with significant engine impact) are consistent across product types but target is a newer engine type where measures likely have similar effectiveness. Severity is aligned with failure effect from retrieved data as rating 8 due to customer dissatisfaction and engine performance loss. Occurrence is rated 3 reflecting occasional failure despite preventive measures 'GASENGDP018 Liner' and 'Drawing specification' which closely match the retrieved context. Detection rating is 4 due to good coverage by comprehensive functional testing and assembly tests (e.g. Fujifilm method), consistent with detected ratings in similar retrieved failure scenarios. This rating reflects high likelihood of detection before customer impact but not guaranteed certainty. Therefore, applying retrieved ratings with slight contextual confirmation is appropriate."
Inadequate gasket design failing to accommodate assembly tolerances or operating conditions,Sealing degradation with combustion gas escaping and emissions increasing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', function 'Sealing between cylinder gasket and liner', failure mode 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner', and failure cause 'Inadequate gasket design...'. The retrieved data presents a highly similar failure mode 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and very closely matching preventive and detective measures. The differences in product version (Type 4 vs. Type 6) are minor and within the same product category and functional environment, suggesting strong applicability of the retrieved ratings. 

Severity: The failure effect 'Sealing degradation with combustion gas escaping and emissions increasing' corresponds to 'Combustion gas is exiting (combustion chamber)' which has a severity rating of 8 in the retrieved context. This aligns with customer dissatisfaction due to reduced sealing and significant emissions impact.

Occurrence: For 'Gasket design' failure cause with existing preventive measures 'Gasket design guidelines' and 'Gasket specification', the retrieved occurrence rating is 2 (Unlikely). This reflects that current preventive measures effectively reduce the likelihood of failure cause.

Detection: Existing detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation (Performance monitoring)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', 'Assembly test (Fujifilm)') match those in the retrieved context associated with a detection rating of 4 (High likelihood of detection in subsequent processes), indicating good chances of detecting inadequate gasket design before customer impact.

Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are robustly applicable and directly usable for the target system with no adjustment needed."

The failure effect ('Engine shutdown due to liner crack') has a severity rating of 7 consistently. All failure causes share the same preventive and detective measures, and occurrence and detection ratings from retrieved data can be adopted directly. No adaptations are necessary since preventive/detective measures and functional context remain unchanged between engine types 4 and 6."

Although the exact gas engine type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure causes, failure effect, and preventive/detective measures are highly consistent. Given this near-perfect alignment of all critical FMEA dimensions and similar complexity, the existing retrieved ratings are fully applicable. Preventive measures such as FEA simulations, design guidelines, and assembly process controls are present and effective, reflected in moderate occurrence ratings. Detection methods including multiple MCE functional and field validation tests support moderately high detectability of failure causes. Severity rating of 8 corresponds to 'Reduced service, customers are dissatisfied' due to combustion gas leakage. Occurrence ratings vary by cause (mostly 3, some 2 or 1) reflecting low to unlikely occurrence thanks to strong preventive controls. Detection ratings are uniformly 4, indicating high likelihood of failure detection before customer delivery through thorough testing and validation. Therefore, the risk ratings from the retrieved data can be used directly without adjustment."
"['Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.)', 'Bolted joint design', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Part is not machined to spec', 'Liner design (geometry, material etc.)', 'Wrong maintenance', 'Crankcase design']",Engine shutdown due to liner crack,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data from a similar Gas Engine Type 4 context for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Provide load path from CH to crankcase), failure mode (Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase), failure causes, and failure effect (Engine shutdown due to liner crack). preventive and detective measures are comparable with a strong alignment in engineering analysis methods and testing approaches. Severity rating is consistent at 7 due to significant operational impact (engine shutdown causing customer dissatisfaction and reduced service). Occurrence ratings of 3 (low likelihood) for most failure causes reflect effective preventive controls implemented (detailed design tolerance guidelines, FEA simulations, assembly trials, and maintenance plans). Detection ratings at 4 signify a high likelihood of detection through functional testing and field validations prior to customer delivery, aligning well with the investigator's existing measures. Thus, risk ratings are directly adopted from retrieved data, ensuring consistency and reliability for this Gas Engine Type 6 application."

The target system is Type 6 but within the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem, component, function, failure mode, failure causes, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar and comprehensive, consistent with those in the retrieved data. Therefore, the severity (7), occurrence (3-5 depending on cause), and detection (mostly 4) ratings from the retrieved data are valid. For multiple failure causes present, occurrence ratings range from 1 (wrong maintenance) to 5 (APR design, liner honing). Detection rating defaults to 4 reflecting high likelihood of detection via extensive MCE functional and field testing prior to customer delivery. Severity is rated 7 reflecting significant system impact (engine stop and damage). No adjustment needed as environmental and operational context is close, and measures equivalently effective."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,Engine stop because of engine damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Cylinder liner assembly, Adverse piston motion over time, Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification, Engine stop because of engine damage) matches very closely with retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures are highly overlapping and consistent (GASENGDP018 Liner, FEA Simulation, Drawing specification, etc.), with additional 3D model analysis and tolerance stackup included in target preventive measures, and extensive MCE functional and field validations in detective measures. Severity is clearly rated at 7 for the failure effect (engine stop due to damage). Occurrence is rated at 3 considering effective preventive measures (tolerances and FEA). Detection is rated slightly better in the retrieved data (5) given assembly tests and functional testing, matching the extensive detective measures in the target system. Therefore, the retrieved ratings for occurrence (3), severity (7), and detection (5) fit well and should be used without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches the target system context very closely: same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Guidance for power unit), failure mode ('Adverse piston motion over time'), failure cause ('Assembly process / Design for assembly'), and failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage'). The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' which represents a later or variant model but still within the same product family and functional context. Preventive and detective measures listed for the target system are more comprehensive but largely overlaps with those in the retrieved data. The retrieved ratings are Severity 7, Occurrence 3, Detection 4. 

Severity: The failure effect 'Engine stop because of engine damage' represents a major functional failure causing engine downtime and customer dissatisfaction. This aligns with a severity rating of 7-8 range. Given similar context and criticality, maintain Severity at 7 to reflect significant service impact but not regulatory violation or catastrophic financial impact.

Occurrence: Retrieved Occurrence rating is 3 - low likelihood considering preventive measures like '3D Model analysis' and 'FPQ'. The target preventive measures are more extensive (additional drawing checks, assembly instructions, RAIP, sensor specs), likely reducing occurrence risk further or at least equivalent to prior rating. Therefore, Occurrence 3 remains appropriate, indicating low likelihood.

Detection: The retrieved Detection rating is 4 (High likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) with detective measures including 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)'. The target has additional detective measures ('Assembly Trial', 'Commissioning Checklist', 'MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)'), which would maintain or slightly improve detectability. Hence, detection rating remains at 4.

Conclusion: Since the contexts and measures align closely, with possibly improved preventive/detective but not drastically different failure consequence, the SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating adaptation results in Severity 7, Occurrence 3, Detection 4."
"Liner design (geometry, material etc.)",Engine stop because of engine damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Cylinder liner assembly, Guidance for power unit, Failure mode: Adverse piston motion over time, Failure cause: Liner design (geometry, material etc.), Failure effect: Engine stop because of engine damage) matches exactly with retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect. Preventive and detective measures are also highly comparable with identical named measures listed in both target and retrieved contexts. Severity rating is consistent (7) reflecting serious customer impact (engine stop/engine damage). Occurrence rating is moderate (3) due to effective preventive simulations/characterizations addressing liner design. Detection rating (5) aligns with detection only through targeted inspections and functional/field testing measures prior to customer delivery. No adjustment needed because both contexts share product category (Gas Engines), similar engine subsystems, identical failure modes/causes/effects, and matching current measures. Therefore, risk ratings from the retrieved data are directly applicable and consistent with the target context."
Wrong maintenance,Engine stop because of engine damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on strong alignment with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Guidance for power unit), failure mode (Adverse piston motion over time), failure cause (Wrong maintenance), and failure effect (Engine stop because of engine damage). Preventive measures ('TA Cylinder Head Maintenance', 'TA Power Unit Maintenance') and detective measures (extensive MCE Functional Testing and Field Validations) match exactly. Ratings are adopted from this exact match but detection rating is adjusted from 4 to 5 due to the additional broader detective measures listed, which mostly indicate targeted to moderate detection (inspection tests), consistent with detection scale 5-6. Severity rating 7 aligns with reduced service causing dissatisfaction (engine stop) but no regulatory violation or extreme damage, occurrences rated very low (1) due to effective preventive activities, detection rating moderate (5) reflecting detection primarily through targeted inspections before failure escalates or customer impact occurs."
Deposit build up (oil),Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved FMEA data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches exactly in Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Cylinder liner assembly), Function (Guidance for power unit), Failure Mode (Adverse piston motion over time), Failure Cause (Deposit build up (oil)), and Failure Effect (Engine stop because of engine damage), with identical preventive and detective measures except for an additional detection measure in the target system. Given that both products belong to the same product category (gas engines) and very similar system contexts, this is a strong contextual match. Minor adaptation is required for detection rating because the target includes more detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', 'Field Validation (Performance Measurement)') than the retrieved context, which suggests slightly better detection ability. Preventive measures are identical, so occurrence rating remains the same. Severity rating is consistent as the failure effect is identical. Final ratings reflect this minor detection improvement."
Crankcase design,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Guidance for power unit), failure mode (Adverse piston motion over time), failure cause (Crankcase design), and failure effect (Engine stop because of engine damage) aligns very closely with the target 'Gas Engine Type 6' system context. Both share identical preventive and detective measures, indicating similar design rigor and inspection methods. Slight generational improvements from Type 4 to Type 6 might reduce occurrence or improve detection marginally; however, without evidence of significant changes, the existing ratings apply accurately. Severity is rated 7 as the failure leads to engine stop but not catastrophic regulatory or safety violations. Occurrence is low (3) due to comprehensive preventive controls like tolerance guidelines, simulation, and design analyses. Detection is moderate (5) as detection relies on targeted functional and component testing and field validation, not automatic or certain detection. Hence, the risk ratings from the similar context are used with no adjustments."
Liner honing,Engine stop because of engine damage,"EXACT_MATCH with Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Guidance for power unit), failure mode (Adverse piston motion over time), failure cause (Liner honing), and failure effect (Engine stop because of engine damage). Preventive and detective measures are also matching very closely. Minor differences between Gas Engine Type 4 and Type 6 are unlikely to affect the severity or risk profile significantly given the identical technical and functional context. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are fully applicable without adjustments."
Piston offset,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, and system element Cylinder liner assembly, with failure mode 'Adverse piston motion over time', failure cause 'Piston offset', and failure effect 'Engine stop because of engine damage'. The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 with exact same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, with identical and closely matching preventive and detective measures. Given the strong alignment in product category, functional context, failure mechanism, and measures, the existing risk ratings are highly applicable. Minor operational or design differences between Type 4 and Type 6 could influence occurrence or detection slightly but without evidence of changed failure likelihood or inspection effectiveness, hence ratings are adopted directly or adjusted minimally. Severity rating remains at 7 due to significant impact (engine stop from engine damage). Occurrence remains at 3 reflecting low likelihood due to effective preventive measures. Detection rating is adapted from 5 (detection only by targeted inspection and field validation) to 5 as well given similar detective methods including Field Validation, MCE Functional Testing, and endurance runs with no indication of improved or degraded detection. Thus, ratings are consistent with retrieved data reflecting similar context and measures."
Liner surface wear,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', which belongs to the same product category (Gas Engines) and shares the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Guidance for power unit), failure mode ('Adverse piston motion over time'), failure cause ('Liner surface wear') and failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage') as found in the retrieved context for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the product type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the functional and failure context is consistent. Preventive and detective measures for the retrieved data are nearly identical to those in the target system, often extended in Type 6 but well-mapped to Type 4 measures. Severity rating remains the same at 7, indicating reduced service and customer dissatisfaction due to engine stop from damage, a critical yet non-regulatory-violation event. Occurrence is rated 3 in the retrieved data, reflecting low likelihood owing to effective preventive measures such as liner design, simulations and maintenance practices, which correspond closely with those in the target. Detection rating is 5, indicating detection primarily by targeted inspections, consistent with the field validations and functional tests employed, which are comprehensive but do not guarantee early detection before customer impact. Given the strong match in context and measures, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable with no downward or upward adjustment. Hence, the exact ratings are recommended for the target system."
Particles in combustion chamber,Engine stop because of engine damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' vs target 'Gas Engine Type 6' within same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect and identical preventive and detective measures. Ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 data (Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=5) apply directly given the match of failure context and measures."
APR design,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with analytical adaptation: The retrieved data contains an EXACT_MATCH for all key attributes except the Product is 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both are gas engines in the same product category and share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function, failure mode (Adverse piston motion), failure cause (APR design), and failure effect (Engine stop because of engine damage). Preventive and detective measures are identical, indicating similar mitigation and detection effectiveness. Therefore, the context is very close but not exact, requiring adjustment consideration for possible improved design maturity or updated controls in Type 6. Since severity (7), occurrence (5), and detection (4) reflect substantial customer impact (engine stop), moderate occurrence despite measures, and relatively good detection through functional testing and field validation, and there are no indications of differing measures or environment between Type 4 and Type 6, the same ratings are appropriate. However, if Type 6 has improvements, occurrence could be slightly better, but lack of concrete evidence means retaining original ratings conservatively is prudent."
"Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.)",Piston ring conformability impaired,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) shares the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Absorption of piston loads), failure mode (Excessive liner deformation), failure cause ('Liner landing design (geometry, roughness, etc.)'), and failure effect ('Piston ring conformability impaired') as retrieved context data from Gas Engine Type 4. There is a strong match except for the engine type version, which is a close but slightly different application context within the same product family and similar operational conditions. Preventive and detective measures in the target context align closely with those in the retrieved data. Severity rating of 6 is consistent with the failure effect impact, representing process disturbance/problems for some customers. Occurrence rating 3 reflects a low likelihood due to mature preventive measures like design guidelines, simulations, tolerance controls, and verified liner design. Detection rating 5 matches detection only by targeted inspections like component inspection, oil analysis, performance measurement, and field validations, consistent with the measures described. Therefore, the existing ratings from the similar context are appropriate and transferred directly without adjustment."

The product category (Gas engine), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), function (Absorption of piston loads), failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect all match perfectly except for minor version difference in engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4), which is same category and very similar context. Preventive and detective measures are exactly the same or very similar, with no notable changes affecting risk ratings. Severity rating is given as 6 for 'Piston ring conformability impaired' (moderate impact on piston sealing, affects some customers/process without regulation violation). Occurrence is rated 3, indicating low likelihood due to effective preventive measures ('GASENGDP018 Liner', 'FEA Simulation', 'Drawing specification'). Detection rating is 5 based on existing targeted inspections and functional tests that detect the issue before customer delivery but not with certainty at all production stages.

The preventive and detective measures listed closely match those in the retrieved data. Severity rating is consistent with the documented failure effect rating of 6. Occurrence is rated 5 due to transient engine operation being an occasional occurrence despite multiple preventive measures including FEA, analysis, and design guidelines. Detection is rated 5 due to reliance on component inspection and functional tests like LOC and blow-by differential pressure measurement, which are targeted inspections rather than certain or high likelihood detection prior to delivery. Hence, all ratings can be directly applied without adjustment."
Part is not machined to specification,Piston ring conformability impaired,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for 'Excessive liner deformation' failure mode in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Engine Block' subsystem in a Gas Engine (Type 4). Although the target product is Type 6, the system element, function, failure mode, failure cause 'Part is not machined to specification', and failure effect 'Piston ring conformability impaired' match exactly with highly similar context (Gas Engine, cylinder liner assembly, same function and failure mode). Preventive and detective measures in the retrieved context align directly with the target measures, indicating the occurrence and detection ratings are appropriate. Severity rating of 6 is consistent with failure effect impact on piston ring conformability causing process disturbance and problems for some customers, matching the severity scale. Therefore, the retrieved ratings can be used directly without adjustment."
"Liner design (geometry, material etc.)",Piston ring conformability impaired,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Excessive liner deformation' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' under 'Engine Block' matches closely with retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' on the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar or identical. Thus, the retrieved ratings can be adapted. Severity rating is consistent at 6 for 'Piston ring conformability impaired' failure effect. Occurrence rating of 3 is appropriate considering existing extensive preventive measures (advanced FEA simulations, material characterization, design guidelines) effectively reduce likelihood. Detection rating of 5 aligns with the detective measures listed (MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation typically require targeted inspections rather than immediate detection), and fits the detection rating pattern for this cause-mode pair. No significant differences in customer impact or environment between Type 4 and Type 6 engines justify rating adjustment. Therefore, original retrieved ratings are directly applicable with confirmation of preventive and detective measures effectiveness."
Piston offset,Piston ring conformability impaired,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved vector query data for Gas Engine Type 4 Cylinder liner assembly 'Excessive liner deformation' failure mode caused by 'Piston offset' with failure effect 'Piston ring conformability impaired'. The product type is Gas Engine, subsystem and system element identical, function and failure mode exactly matching. Preventive and detective measures listed match the target system context. Severity rating of 6 is consistent with the failure effect impact on piston ring function (process disturbance, some customer issues). Occurrence rating of 3 reflects the low likelihood given established preventive measures including simulation and liner design controls. Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection through targeted inspections such as component inspection and functional testing, as per existing detective measures. Thus, all ratings are used directly from retrieved data."
Liner surface wear,Piston ring conformability impaired,"EXACT_MATCH due to multiple retrieved data points describing the failure mode 'Excessive liner deformation' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a Gas Engine (specifically Gas Engine Type 4, close to target Type 6 in same product category and system context). The failure cause 'Liner surface wear' and failure effect 'Piston ring conformability impaired' are explicitly present with consistent preventive and detective measures closely matching the target context. Severity is consistently rated as 6 reflecting process disturbance/problem for some customers but not critical shutdown. Occurrence rating is 3 indicating low likelihood thanks to preventive measures like 'GASENGDP018 Liner' and simulation analyses. Detection rating is 5 reflecting detection only through targeted inspections and field validations, aligned with the described detective measures. No need for adjustment because the preventive/detective measures and subsystem function are very similar, and the risk impact is consistent for the same failure effect. Therefore, direct use of retrieved ratings is justified."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Adverse piston motion' caused by 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' leading to 'Engine stop because of engine damage' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Relevant retrieved data includes very similar failure modes (exact or near exact failure mode names) in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same system element and failure cause and effect, with aligned preventive ('GASENGDP018 Liner', 'FEA Simulation', 'Drawing specification') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing', 'Field Validation', 'Overload and endurance run'). This matches the SIMILAR_CONTEXT because although the product type differs (Type 4 vs. Type 6), the system element, failure mode, cause, effect and environment are highly comparable within the same product category (gas engines). Severity rating of 7 is consistent as the failure effect ('Engine stop due to engine damage') is high impact. Preventive measures effectively reduce occurrence, supporting an occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood with current measures). Detection capability is moderate, based on the given functional testing and validation methods, supporting a detection rating between 4 and 5; the more comprehensive methods including endurance runs justify a detection rating of 4 reflecting detection before customer impact is likely but requires targeted inspections or functional tests. Given the similarity and aligned measures, adopting the retrieved ratings but preferring the detection rating of 4 for the given measure set is appropriate."

The retrieved data includes exact failure cause and effect matching but from 'Gas Engine Type 4', the immediate predecessor version but same product category and subsystem context. Functions are slightly different ('Absorption of piston loads' vs 'Guidance for power unit'), yet failure modes and causes match closely ('Adverse piston motion'). Preventive and detective measures are identical ('3D Model analysis' and 'Assembly Trial (Power Unit fitting)'). Severity rating is 7 in retrieved data, reflecting reduced service to customer with engine stop damage - appropriate to target context since engine stop due to damage is highly critical, but not rated 9-10 as this does not explicitly describe regulatory violation or massive financial loss beyond the immediate engine failure. Occurrence rating is 3 in retrieved data, indicating low likelihood with existing preventive measures, which is consistent given the preventive '3D Model analysis' and controlled assembly process. Detection rating is 4, reflecting high likelihood of detection at assembly trial stage before delivery, which applies equally here. Given the close match in failure mode, cause, effect, preventive and detective measures, and product family similarity, the exact retrieved ratings are valid with no adjustment needed."
Part is not machined to specification,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, with failure mode 'Adverse piston motion' caused by 'Part is not machined to specification' and resulting in 'Engine stop because of engine damage'. The retrieved context data is for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), same failure mode or very close ('Adverse piston motion' and 'Adverse piston motion over time'), same failure cause ('Part is not machined to spec'), and identical failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage' with severity 7). Preventive measures and detective measures listed in the retrieval align well with those in the target context (e.g., drawing specifications, liner quality plans, MCE Functional Testing with component inspection, endurance testing, etc.), indicating a strong technical and procedural similarity. The severity rating is consistent and clear at 7, reflecting severe customer impact (engine stops due to engine damage). The occurrence rating in retrieval is 3 (low likelihood) considering the existing preventive measures which match the target's measures. Detection rating varies slightly in retrieval between 4 and 5 depending on mode details; given the extensive and layered detection methods in the target (including multiple functional tests, assembly tests, and field validation) and their effectiveness, detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) is appropriate. Thus, the retrieved ratings are valid for the new context, with slight adjustment to detection rating due to comprehensive detection steps in the target context, offering higher chances of detection than the similar 'Adverse piston motion over time' failure mode context where detection was rated 5. Overall, a SIMILAR_CONTEXT match with adaptation to detection rating reflecting fully applied detective measures is the best approach."
"Liner design (geometry, material etc.)",Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Cylinder liner assembly), same function ('Absorption of piston loads' vs 'Guidance for power unit' which is a closely related function for piston motion control), same failure mode ('Adverse piston motion'), same failure cause ('Liner design (geometry, material etc.)'), and same failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage'). The preventive measures listed in both contexts are extensive and substantially overlapping, strongly indicating similar effectiveness. The detective measures in the target context are more comprehensive and also include all key tests referenced in the retrieved context. Given the closer functional and failure cause match, the severity rating is consistent at 7 (indicating serious operational impact with engine stop). Occurrence rating stays at 3 due to effective preventive measures such as extensive FEA simulations, material characterization, and design validations, indicating a low likelihood of occurrence. Detection rating is improved slightly from 4 to 3-4 range in the retrieved data depending on measures; with the target context having broader and more thorough detective measures including overload/endurance runs, thermal surveys, and blow-by measurement monitoring, detection likelihood is high in subsequent processes but not certain before delivery. Hence, detection rating is set at 4, consistent with high likelihood but not certainty of detection before failure at the customer end. Therefore, the exact retrieved ratings cannot be directly adopted due to slight differences in detective measures completeness, but the similarity justifies using the retrieved values mostly unchanged."
APR design,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved exact match data is for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), failure mode ('Adverse piston motion'), failure cause ('APR design'), and failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage'). The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' but with identical functional context and preventive/detective measures matching exactly. Since the product differs but is in the same product category (gas engines) and the system/subsystem element and failure scenario is identical, this falls under SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The retrieved ratings are Severity 7, Occurrence 5, Detection 4. These align well with the measures described, indicating moderate occurrence despite preventive design & simulation, a high customer-impact severity (engine stop causing dissatisfaction but not regulatory violation), and a fairly good detection capability given the functional and endurance testing. No significant differences in the target context justify rating adjustments. Hence, the ratings are adopted as-is."
Wrong maintenance,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, Cylinder liner assembly, Engine Block subsystem, with failure mode 'Adverse piston motion' caused by 'Wrong maintenance' causing 'Engine stop because of engine damage'. The retrieved data corresponds to Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, failure mode and cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures in retrieved data match exactly the target system. Severity rating for the failure effect 'Engine stop because of engine damage' is consistently rated 7, indicating significant customer dissatisfaction due to engine stop but no regulatory violation or extreme financial damage beyond typical expectations. Occurrence rating is 1, reflecting very low likelihood due to robust preventive measures 'TA Cylinder Head Maintenance' and 'TA Power Unit Maintenance' effectively reducing occurrence of wrong maintenance. Detection rating is 4-5 in the retrieved context; given the more extensive detective measures in target system including multiple MCE Functional Testing procedures plus Field Validation and Assembly tests, detection likelihood is slightly better than minimal detection (5) but not certain detection (1-2). Therefore, a detection rating of 4 is appropriate, reflecting high likelihood of detection before customer delivery through targeted inspections and functional tests. Hence, severity remains at 7, occurrence at 1, and detection adjusted slightly from 5 to 4 to reflect better detective measures in target system compared to retrieval."
Crankcase design,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Cylinder liner assembly, Engine Block subsystem) shares the same product category, subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect as the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4. The preventive and detective measures listed for the target system align closely with those in the retrieved data. The failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage') has a consistent severity rating of 7 in the references related to adverse piston motion caused by crankcase design. Since the design and analysis tools and testing methods appear comparable with slightly newer or similar generation engine, the severity rating remains the same (7) as it directly impacts engine stop and damage, critical for customer and system impact.

Occurrence rating in the retrieved data for the same failure cause (crankcase design) with very similar preventive measures is 3, indicating low likelihood due to established design tolerance guidelines and extensive simulations and analyses already implemented. Given that Gas Engine Type 6 likely benefits from lessons learned and possibly incremental improvements over Type 4, occurrence stays at 3, reflecting the low likelihood of adverse piston motion caused by crankcase design under robust preventive measures.

Detection ratings vary slightly in the retrieved references (4 to 5) depending on the specific detection methods applied. Considering the target system includes comprehensive functional testing, component inspection, and field validation related to cavitation, LOC, oil filter lifetime monitoring, and overload/endurance runs, detection is better than just targeted inspection but not guaranteed prior to delivery. Thus, setting Detection at 4 reflects a high likelihood of detection through ongoing functional and component inspections and endurance testing before the failure causes engine stoppage.

This rating set aligns well with existing knowledge, measures, and the similar system context, fulfilling the SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating methodology and ensuring consistency and applicability for the target Gas Engine Type 6."
Piston offset,Engine stop because of engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Cylinder liner assembly'), function ('Absorption of piston loads'), failure mode ('Adverse piston motion'), failure cause ('Piston offset'), and failure effect ('Engine stop because of engine damage') as in the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although there is a slight product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6), the engine function and failure scenario context are highly similar within the same product category and subsystem context. Preventive measures match closely, with the same suite of simulation and liner analysis tools applied. Detective measures in the target system are more comprehensive, including additional MCE functional testing types and oil filter lifetime monitoring, which suggests possibly better detection coverage. Severity is consistent considering the same failure effect and critical engine damage outcome. Occurrence in Type 4 is rated 3 (low likelihood/ preventive measures effective). Given that Type 6 likely leverages similar or improved preventive measures, occurrence rating remains at 3. Detection in Type 4 for this failure cause/mode is 4 or 5 depending on specific testing sets; with additional detective measures in Type 6 that enhance detection likelihood beyond Type 4's baseline, detection rating is adjusted slightly lower to 4 (better detectability than 5 but not certain detection)."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,Coolant leakage into combustion chamber,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data show an exact match on product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), failure mode (Cavitation failure), failure cause (Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification), and failure effect (Coolant leakage into combustion chamber) for Gas Engine Type 4 vs the target Gas Engine Type 6. Preventive and detective measures are very similar or identical with minor expected evolution from Type 4 to Type 6. Severity is consistently rated as 8 due to the critical impact of coolant leakage into the combustion chamber causing customer dissatisfaction and potential engine damage. Occurrence is rated 3 reflecting low likelihood given the strong preventive measures (precision liner specs, FEA simulation, drawing specs) effectively controlling geometry/tolerance issues. Detection rating in the retrieved data is 3, indicating high likelihood of detecting issues by extensive functional and component inspections and tests prior to customer delivery. Considering Type 6 likely has equal or improved design and testing rigor, the retrieved ratings are applicable with no adjustment needed. Thus, ratings from Type 4 context directly apply as a very close similar context and yield reliable risk ratings."
Honing structure of liner,High oil consumption,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to the retrieved context data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode ('Too much oil on the liner'), failure cause ('Honing structure of liner'), and failure effect ('High oil consumption'). Preventive and detective measures are identical or highly similar. Minor differences in model type likely do not significantly change the failure impact or detection/prevention effectiveness. Severity is consistent due to direct customer impact (high oil consumption causing dissatisfaction and reduced service). Occurrence is moderate due to existing preventive measures but failure cause still possible (slew rating 5 in retrieved data). Detection is moderate (rated 5) since detection requires targeted inspection tests (field split and endurance tests) before customer delivery, which fits the known tests in target context. Thus, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 can be directly adapted with no adjustment needed for the new Type 6 engine."
Wear of liner honing structure,High oil consumption,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' (same product category, same subsystem - Engine Block, same system element - Crankcase, identical function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect). Preventive and detective measures are identical and comparable, indicating similar risk landscape. The severity rating of 8 reflects a significant customer dissatisfaction due to high oil consumption, consistent with the operational impact on the engine. Occurrence rating of 5 indicates occasional occurrence despite preventive measures, which aligns well with experience from Type 4 engines and similar wear patterns expected in Type 6. Detection rating of 5 matches the effectiveness of current detective measures such as field split tests and honing wear measurements, which require targeted inspections to detect the failure. Given these strong equivalences, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable with no adjustments for the Type 6 context."
Oil type and maintenance,High oil consumption,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and the retrieved data (Gas Engine Type 4) share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode ('Too much oil on the liner'), failure cause ('Oil type and maintenance'), and failure effect ('High oil consumption'). Preventive and detective measures are identical or closely matching. The key difference is the engine type version (6 vs 4), which is an evolution but within the same product category and functional context. Given the consistency of preventive/detective measures, similar operating environment, and failure effect criticality, it is appropriate to adopt the retrieved ratings with minimal adjustment. No evidence suggests increased risk or decreased detectability for Type 6. Therefore, severity remains at 8 (significant customer dissatisfaction due to high oil consumption and likely reduced service life/cost impact). Occurrence remains low likelihood (2) due to effective preventive measures including oil analysis, maintenance plans, and CFD analysis. Detection remains moderate at 5 since detection is through targeted inspection methods (endurance runs and oil quality monitoring), not certain or immediate. This aligns well with the provided definition scales."
Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance),High oil consumption,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data corresponds exactly in subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode (Too much oil on the liner), failure cause (Misalignment of PCJ), and failure effect (High oil consumption) but from 'Gas Engine Type 4' versus 'Gas Engine Type 6' in the same product category (gas engines). Preventive measure ('TA xxx / Assembly guideline') and detective measure ('Engine run in') match exactly. Given the strong similarity of the context, function, component, failure cause, effects, and the identical preventive and detective measures, the risk ratings from the Type 4 engine apply with no adjustment needed. Severity is 8 due to high oil consumption causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction. Occurrence is rated 5 indicating occasional occurrence despite preventive assembly guidelines. Detection rating is 5 reflecting detection only through targeted inspection during engine run-in (first fire and after service). Hence, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable."
Honing structure of liner,Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode ('Too much oil on the liner'), failure cause (Honing structure of liner), and failure effect (Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure). Despite slight difference in engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category, subsystem, component, function, failure mode, cause, and effects are consistent and measures (preventive and detective) are the same. The retrieved ratings are occurrence 5 (occasional), detection 5 (detection only through targeted inspection), and severity 8 (reduced service and customer dissatisfaction as piston seizure impacts engine operation heavily but stops short of regulatory or catastrophic failures). These ratings align well with the provided existing measures and failure effect impact on the customer/end-system."
Wear of liner honing structure,Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data matches almost exactly the failure mode 'Too much oil on the liner' with the failure cause 'Wear of liner honing structure' and failure effect 'Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure' in the 'Crankcase' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem, but in 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both product types belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem/component context is identical. Preventive and detective measures listed are the same or highly similar, indicating similar risk controls effectiveness. Therefore, direct use of exact ratings would be reasonable but slight adaptation is recommended to consider possible incremental differences in engine generation or usage conditions. The severity rating for this failure effect is consistently 8 (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction due to significant piston seizure risk). The occurrence rating is given as 5 (occasional occurrence) considering the applied preventive practices including design standards and testing. The detection rating is consistently 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) since detection methods rely on long-duration endurance and wear measurement testing. Given the similarity and no evidence that Type 6 has more severe or less controlled risk, maintaining these ratings is appropriate. Slight caution for occurrence rating could adjust ±1 depending on changes in engine design or operational conditions, but no evidence is provided, so the original rating stands. Hence, recommended risk ratings are: Severity=8, Occurrence=5, Detection=5."
Oil type and maintenance,Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode ('Too much oil on the liner'), failure cause ('Oil type and maintenance'), and failure effect ('Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure'). Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same context provides the following ratings. Preventive measures ('Supplier recommendation', '1d oil analysis', 'Oil guideline TA xxx', 'Oil maintenance plan', 'CFD Analysis') and detective measures ('Endurance run (LOC & Oil quality measurement)', 'Field validation (LOC & Oil quality measurement)', 'Oil functional test') exactly match those in retrieved data, confirming rating applicability without adjustment."
Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance),Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure,"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'Too much oil on the liner' with the failure cause 'Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance)' and failure effect 'Piston deposit build up leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure' is documented explicitly in the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive measures match ('TA xxx / Assembly guideline'), and detective measures match ('Engine run in (first fire and after service event)'). Given the strong alignment in all FMEA elements and provided preventive/detective measures, exact retrieved ratings are applicable with no adjustment needed for Gas Engine Type 6 due to the high similarity in engine family and functional conditions."
Wear of liner honing structure,"Increased bore polishing causing increased blow-by, eventually leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) is closely related to the retrieved data context (Gas Engine Type 4), sharing the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode ('Too little oil on the liner'), failure cause ('Wear of liner honing structure'), and failure effect (Increasing bore polishing leading to piston/ring seizure). The retrieved ratings come from a very similar context but a different product variant (Type 4 vs Type 6). Given the consistency in failure mechanisms, preventive and detective measures, and assuming no substantial changes in design or operational conditions, we can apply the retrieved ratings with minor validation based on current measures."
Oil type and maintenance,"Increased bore polishing causing increased blow-by, eventually leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure","EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 system where the failure mode 'Too little oil on the liner' caused by 'Oil type and maintenance' with same preventive and detective measures is documented. Given the direct match in product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode, failure cause and failure effect, the retrieved ratings are fully applicable without needing adjustment. The preventive measures and detective measures in the target system are identical to those in the retrieved context, supporting the equivalence in occurrence and detection ratings. Severity rating is consistent since the failure effect impact described is the same (increased bore polishing, blow-by, scuffing, and piston/ring seizure)."
Thermal boundary conditions,"Increased bore polishing causing increased blow-by, eventually leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure","EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Too little oil on the liner' caused by 'Thermal boundary conditions' and resulting in 'Increased bore polishing causing increased blow-by, eventually leading to scuffing and piston/ring seizure' is an exact match to retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures listed are identical and consistent with retrieved data. Therefore, the existing risk ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection can be directly applied without adjustment."
Oil type and maintenance,Lack of lubrication of critical engine components leading to accelerated wear and potential fatal engine failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Too little oil flow' caused by 'Oil type and maintenance' affecting the crankcase oil lubrication function. Retrieved data shows an exact match with a Gas Engine Type 4 system – same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function, failure mode and failure cause, and similar preventive and detective measures. Severity rating in the retrieved context is 8 due to 'Lack of lubrication of critical systems leading to fatal engine failure', which is consistent for the failure effect severity level described. Occurrence rating of 2 is assigned considering preventive measures very similar in nature and expected effectiveness (supplier recommendations, oil analysis, maintenance plan, CFD analysis). Detection rating of 5 matches the detective measures involving endurance runs, field validations, and oil functional tests, which detect the issue but only through targeted testing and not before customer delivery. Minor contextual difference from Gas Engine Type 4 to Type 6 (likely similar product category and operational context) does not significantly alter severity or detection ratings. Occurrence rating remains low given the effectiveness of preventive measures. Hence, direct usage of retrieved ratings with rationale on very similar context and measures is justified."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Lack of lubrication of critical engine components leading to accelerated wear and potential fatal engine failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is a 'Too little oil flow' failure mode in the 'Crankcase' component of 'Gas Engine Type 6', while highly relevant retrieved data are for 'Too little oil flow' and similar failure modes in 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 4', same product category and functional context (engine lubrication system). Preventive and detective measures closely match: '1d analysis', DP codes for oil components, and oil pressure monitoring tests. Severity from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for 'Too little oil flow' caused by 'Oil circuit design' is rated 8 due to risk of fatal engine failure—consistent with the target failure effect of lack of lubrication causing accelerated wear and potential fatal failure, so Severity is adopted as 8. Occurrence rated as 2 in retrieved data, reflecting robust preventive measures targeting oil circuit design, which matches the provided preventive measures effectiveness and the likelihood in the target system is expected similar; hence Occurrence is 2. Detection rated as 3 in retrieved data, corresponding to high likelihood detection by oil functional tests and endurance runs before delivery—matching the target detective measures and realistic detection capabilities. Overall, ratings from the highly similar failure mode and causes in Gas Engine Type 4 are applied with justified context adjustment confirming equivalency."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Particle contamination in oil causing premature bearing failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'Cleanliness not given' on the 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches exactly with a retrieved failure mode from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)'), and failure effect ('Particle contamination in oil causing premature bearing failure') within the same product category (gas engines) and functional context. Preventive and detective measures are also the same or highly similar. Therefore, it is appropriate to directly use the retrieved risk ratings. The retrieved severity rating is 8 indicating serious impact due to premature bearing failure. The occurrence is rated 2, reflecting the effectiveness of the several preventive design and analysis measures on the oil circuit. Detection rating of 3 reflects good detection capability via oil functional tests and endurance runs before customer delivery."
Oil type and maintenance,Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function (Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system), identical failure mode ('High concentration of oil in gas mixture'), identical failure cause ('Oil type and maintenance'), and identical failure effect ('Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency') provides a close match to the target Gas Engine Type 6 context. The preventive and detective measures are essentially the same for both types. Given the slightly newer or different engine type (6 instead of 4), but within the same product category and system context, the existing ratings can be adopted with minimal adjustments. Severity remains 4 since the failure effect and customer/process impact are consistent. Occurrence remains 2 reflecting effective preventive measures reducing likelihood. Detection remains 5 due to detection requiring targeted inspections (oil functional tests and endurance runs). No significant change in measures or environment suggests direct reuse of retrieved ratings is valid but tagged as SIMILAR_CONTEXT due to different engine version. Ratings are consistent and reasonable for the target context."
Thermal boundary conditions,Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match except for the product variant (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6). The system element (Crankcase), subsystem (Engine Block), function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and preventive and detective measures match exactly. Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) with very similar design and operational contexts. Therefore, the risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 can be adopted with high confidence. The preventive measures such as 'Design practice 18 - Cylinder liner', FEA, CFD, and oil guidelines remain effective in the newer Type 6 engine, indicating the occurrence rating remains valid (4 - occasional occurrence). Detective measures including endurance runs, field validations, thermal and oil functional tests enable detection mostly through targeted inspections, supporting a detection rating of 5. Severity rating is consistent at 4 indicating process disturbance and some customer issues but no critical damage or regulatory breaches. Hence, all ratings are valid with no adjustments necessary."
Position of blow-by extraction,Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH based on strong alignment of all parameters (Product category: Gas Engine; Subsystem: Engine Block; SystemElement: Crankcase; Function: Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system; FailureMode: High concentration of oil in gas mixture; FailureCause: Position of blow-by extraction; FailureEffect: Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency). The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 while target is Gas Engine Type 6, same product category and highly similar engine system context. Preventive and detective measures match exactly, so no adjustments needed. The severity rating aligns with impact of moderate process disturbance; occurrence reflects occasional failure given preventive CFD, benchmarking and design analyses; detection reflects high likelihood of detection by current functional and endurance tests. Therefore, the retrieved ratings can be directly applied."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Crankcase' element, with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' is highly similar to multiple retrieved data entries from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem but mostly focused on the 'CCV (blow-by) system' component. Both systems are gas engines in the same product category (industrial gas engines), and the failure involves leakage of blow-by gas and oil to environment, caused by assembly and design for assembly. Preventive measures (FPQ, Drawing & 3D Model Check, Assembly Instructions, RAIP, Sensor specification) and detective measures (Assembly Trial, Commissioning Checklist, MCE Functional Testing) are the same or largely overlapping.

Severity: The retrieved severity ratings for exactly same failure effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' are 4 in the direct 'CCV system' context (Type 4 engine), but some entries show severe consequences (e.g. 'Oil/Mixture leakage' rated 10 severity for sealing in V-room insulation, a more critical sealing element). Since the Crankcase leaks are less severe than major sealing failures impacting regulatory compliance or massive financial damage, and the customer's impact is environmental leakage causing disturbance but not regulatory violation, a severity rating of 4 (process disturbance, some customer problems) is appropriate and consistent with retrieved data.

Occurrence: For failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' with preventive measures listed, retrieved data indicate occurrence ratings of 5 (occasional occurrence) in both exact and similar failure modes. This reflects that despite preventive measures, assembly/design issues are occasional but not rare, consistent with real-world assembly complexities.

Detection: Existing detective measures (Assembly Trial, Commissioning Checklist, MCE Functional Testing) are the same as in retrieved cases with detection ratings of 4–6. The retrieved cases for the identical failure cause and similar failure modes used detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) or 5 (targeted inspection). Given commissioning and testing include functional testing for CCV system and assembly trials before delivery, detecting assembly flaws before customer delivery is likely but not guaranteed. Therefore, detection rating of 4 (high likelihood in subsequent process) fits the context better than 5.

Conclusion: Ratings directly from retrieved similar context (Type 4, CCV system) are adapted to target element Crankcase leakage with justification that same cause & effect, preventive/detective measures match well. Severity kept at 4 due to customer/environmental impact being noticeable but not regulatory severe. Occurrence kept at 5 as occasional failures despite measures. Detection improved to 4 reflecting effective process testing and commissioning before customer delivery."
CCV (blow-by) system design,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows detailed FMEA ratings for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, failure modes involving leakage of blow-by gas caused by CCV (blow-by) system design, with failure effects matching 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment'. Although the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 and the system element is the crankcase (function directing/leads oil-gas mixture to CCV), the failure cause (CCV system design), failure mode, and failure effect are the same and within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (engine block). Preventive and detective measures overlap significantly. Therefore, this is a SIMILAR_CONTEXT case. 

Severity: The existing rating is 4, indicating process disturbance, problem for some customers—appropriate for oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment without violation of regulations or severe financial damage assumed. The same severity rating is consistent across retrieved data and fits the target context.

Occurrence: The retrieved occurrence rating for the failure cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design' is 3 (Low likelihood) with the existing preventive measures very similar (FEA simulation, cable guidelines, sensor specifications). Given no major differences in design complexity or operating environment that would increase or reduce risk drastically between Engine Type 4 and Type 6, this rating remains applicable.

Detection: Detection rating is 2 (Certain detection in subsequent processes), supported by detective measures such as MCE Functional Testing, field validation, crankcase pressure monitoring, and vibration measurement. These measures enable early detection before customer impact.

Thus, it is justified to adopt the retrieved ratings directly with confidence for the target context."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' with cause 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' and effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' is reported in Gas Engine Type 4 in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' component, while the target is Gas Engine Type 6 in the Crankcase component. Both belong to the 'Engine Block' subsystem in the same product category (Gas Engines) with functions related to directing oil-blow-by gas mixture to the CCV system. Preventive and detective measures ('Maintenance Plan and Instruction', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring', 'Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring') are identical. Given system element similarity (Crankcase vs CCV system closely linked) and same failure cause, mode, and effect, this is a similar context but not exact due to different system element and engine type, which may slightly affect occurrence likelihood and detection effectiveness. Severity is consistent as the effect on environment and customer/process disturbance is similar, so retained as 4. Occurrence remains low (2) reflecting effective maintenance. Detection at 4 (high likelihood detection via pressure monitoring) fits the current monitoring strategy. Minor adjustment is not necessary because operational and preventive/detective contexts are comparable in engine generation and function."
Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.),High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function directing oil-gas mixture to CCV system with failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' caused by 'Oil deposit build up', resulting in 'High pressure in Crankcase'. Retrieved data is for Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element CCV (blow-by) system, with very similar failure modes and identical failure cause and effect, with the same preventive and detective measures. Both engines are in the same product category (gas engines) and functional context (engine block crankcase related flow). The difference is system element identity: retrieved data focuses more on the CCV system whereas target focuses on the Crankcase itself; however, function and failure modes are almost identical and failure cause/effect are the same. Preventive and detective measures match exactly, implying similar failure likelihood and detection capability. Severity rating must be consistent for same failure effect: retrieved severity is 4. Occurrence in retrieved data is moderate (5), considering maintenance and design preventive measures. Detection rating is very good (2) due to strong system monitoring and functional tests. For Gas Engine Type 6 Crankcase, the failure impact likely is comparable—pressure build-up is similarly impactful but no increased severity factors noted. Preventive and detection measures appear equally effective. Therefore, severity remains 4, occurrence remains 5 due to similar preventive measures, and detection remains strong at 2. Minor adjustment is not required as environment and operation are similar gas engine types and monitoring approaches are equally robust."
Design for vibration,High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, function directing Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV system) closely matches the retrieved context of Gas Engine Type 4 in the Engine Block subsystem with failure cause 'Design for vibration' and failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' leading to failure effect 'High pressure in Crankcase'. Preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved context overlap largely with the target system's measures, indicating similar maturity of controls. Severity rating of 4 for 'High pressure in Crankcase' is consistent with a process disturbance and some customer impact but no regulatory or financial violation, which suits both engine types. Occurrence rated at 3 in Gas Engine Type 4 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive measures such as FEA simulations and specified sealing. Detection at 4 reflects good likelihood of detection by functional testing and field vibration monitoring, matching the target's similar detective methods. Given similar product category, subsystem context, failure cause, and preventive/detective measures, retrieved ratings are adapted with no need to change severity, occurrence, or detection ratings."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function directing Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV system, failure mode disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time, failure cause assembly process / design for assembly, failure effect high pressure in crankcase) closely matches a retrieved failure scenario from Gas Engine Type 4. The retrieved data matches the subsystem (Engine Block), system functional relation (flow path affecting CCV system), failure cause and preventive and detective measures are identical. The main difference is the product version (Type 6 vs Type 4), which may imply incremental design improvements but essentially the same functional context and system operating principles within the same product category (gas engines). Hence, adapting retrieved ratings is justified.

Severity rating in the retrieved data is 4, indicating process disturbance/problems for some customers, which is fitting for high crankcase pressure that causes operational inefficiency or some service disturbances but not regulatory violation or major damage. Preventive measures are thorough (FPQ, drawing and 3D model check, assembly instructions, RAIP, sensor specification) supporting limited occurrence. Occurrence rating retrieved is 5 (occasional occurrence), which corresponds to a moderate likelihood given assembly complexity and design-for-assembly challenges.

Detection rating retrieved is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) supported by assembly trial and MCE functional testing of the CCV system, which allows good but not perfect detection before delivery.

For the target system, the preventive and detective measures are the same, so the occurrence and detection ratings remain appropriate without adjustment. Severity is consistent for the failure effect 'high pressure in crankcase'.

Therefore, the adapted ratings for the target system remain Severity=4, Occurrence=5, Detection=4, consistent with the similar context retrieved scenario."
Crankcase design,High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function directing oil-gas mixture to the CCV system with failure mode causing disturbance in flow path over time due to crankcase design and resulting in high crankcase pressure. The retrieved exact data is for Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element CCV (blow-by) system (functionally adjacent), same failure mode, cause, and effect, with the same or very similar preventive and detective measures. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and similar engine block context. The key difference is the specific system element focus (Crankcase in target vs CCV system in retrieved) but functionally closely related with common failure cause (crankcase design) and failure effect (high crankcase pressure). Preventive and detective measures overlap, showing similar mitigation and detection capabilities. Severity of 4 from the retrieved data corresponds to process disturbance/problems for some customers, which fits the impact of high crankcase pressure affecting oil-gas flow path over time without immediate critical failure or regulatory violation; this is consistent across similar failure effects in this product domain. Occurrence rating of 6 (occasional occurrence) reflects that preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate the risk, appropriate given the nature of design-related failures which may appear intermittently over time. Detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) aligns with the detective measures listed (functional testing, field pressure monitoring) requiring targeted monitoring rather than automatic detection. Given the high similarity in failure cause, effect, measures, and functionally close system element, adapting the retrieved rating directly to target with minor validation is justified. The slight system element difference does not materially impact severity or probability ratings due to functional adjacency and same product application context. Thus, the rating values are exactly applicable with the given preventive and detective measures in place."
CCV (blow-by) system design,High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', Crankcase directing oil-gas mixture to CCV system, with failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' and failure cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design' causing 'High pressure in Crankcase'. Retrieved data shows a very similar scenario in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem Engine Block and related failure mode/failure cause/effect and equivalent preventive and detective measures. 'Gas Engine Type 6' is a newer/related version in the same product category and functional domain, so risk ratings can be adapted from the retrieved ratings with a reasoning check. The severity rating 4 aligns with a moderate process disturbance, not reaching regulatory or financial damage. Occurrence rating is 3 (low likelihood) due to effective preventive measures like FEA simulation and sensor specs, consistent with the retrieved data. Detection rating 2 indicates high likelihood of detection by in-process functional and field validation tests, matching measures listed. The target system lists an additional detective measure ('Vibration measurement') that improves detection confidence, so detection rating 2 is maintained. Thus, the existing retrieved ratings are fully applicable with confidence for the target context."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter', failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', failure effect 'High pressure in Crankcase'. Retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element CCV (blow-by) system, similar function 'Distributes blow-by gas to filter system', same failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar with identical naming of key measures. Severity in retrieved data is rated 4, occurrence 5, and detection 4. Given the similarity of function and same product family with only a minor change in engine type, the severity remains consistent at 4 as the failure effect (high pressure in crankcase) has similar impact on system operation and customers. Occurrence is maintained at 5 since assembly processes and design for assembly preventive measures are similar in effectiveness, but assembly errors still occur occasionally. Detection remains 4 as the detective measures like Assembly Trial and MCE Functional Testing (CCV System) ensure a high likelihood of detecting the failure before customer delivery. No strong justification for upward or downward adjustment in this context; hence the retrieved ratings are used with confidence."
Piping design,High pressure in Crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' caused by 'Piping design' leading to 'High pressure in Crankcase' in a closely related product ('Gas Engine Type 4'). The preventive and detective measures listed in the retrieved data are identical to the target system ('FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP048 Piping' and comprehensive vibration/modal, functional tests, and field validations including crankcase pressure monitoring). Both subsystems are 'Engine Block', and system elements are related to gas flow management (CCV system vs Crankcase leading gas to CCV). The function and failure effect severity are consistent and similar. Given the highly analogous engineering context, product category, and matching measures, we directly transfer the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6. However, a minor adjustment accounts for potentially improved system maturity in the newer Gas Engine Type 6 (assuming incremental design improvements and similar procedural application) - thus, occurrence and detection remain same as the retrieved ratings as preventive/detective measures are equal in extent and rigor, and severity is matched to the failure effect on customers/process."
Intake system (Gas mixer),Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' in the Crankcase directing Oil-Gas mixture to CCV system caused by 'Intake system (Gas mixer)'. Retrieved data shows nearly exact failure mode, cause, preventive and detective measures but in Gas Engine Type 4. The product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), and functional context are same; only product type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4). Preventive and detective measures are identical. Severity is consistent because leakage to environment impacts environment and customers similarly across types. Occurrence is consistent due to identical preventive measures and failure cause. Detection ratings remain same given identical detective measures and monitoring systems. Hence, direct adaptation is justified with no rating adjustments."
Power unit,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same failure mode, cause, effect, and preventive/detective measures as the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same product category and subsystem context, but in a slightly different system element (Crankcase vs CCV (blow-by) system) and engine type. The severity rating of 4 from 'Type 4' applies as the leakage effect impact is similar (environmental leakage causing process disturbances). Preventive measures (GASENGDP007 Power Unit, Design verification of power unit) and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing, Crankcase pressure monitoring, Blow-By Filter differential pressure monitoring) are identical in both contexts. Occurrence rating is 6 (occasional occurrence) reflecting existing preventive measure effectiveness, consistent with Type 4 data. Detection rating is 5 (detection through targeted inspections) consistent with Type 4, given that the failure detection depends on monitoring and functional testing, not immediate process or customer detection. No significant operational environment or regulatory impact differences exist to merit adjustment. Thus, ratings are borrowed and confirmed as suitable for the target context."
Piping design,Oil leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsys Engine Block, SystemElement Crankcase, function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment', caused by 'Piping design'. Retrieved data shows a closely similar failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment' with the same failure cause 'Piping design' in the Gas Engine Type 4 system for the 'CCV (blow-by) system' in the Engine Block. Preventive and detective measures are identical or highly similar; however, target failure is in Crankcase vs CCV system in Gas Engine Type 6 vs 4. 

Severity: The retrieved severity is 4, indicating process disturbance/problems for some customers, which fits oil leakage to environment without regulatory or major financial impact. No compelling reason exists to adjust severity since failure effect is oil leakage visible to environment but not catastrophic.

Occurrence: Retrieved occurrence rating is 3 (low likelihood) with preventive measures including 'FEA Simulation' and 'GASENGDP048 Piping'. Given equivalent preventive measures and similar failure cause, occurrence remains 3.

Detection: Retrieved detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) via several vibration and functional tests, plus field validations and crankcase pressure monitoring. Given combined detective measures are in place and effective, detection rating remains 4.

Overall, though the exact SystemElement differs slightly (Crankcase vs CCV system), the functional context and failure cause are very close within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem. Thus, the retrieved ratings are valid with no adjustment.
"
O-Ring aging,Oil leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment over time' caused by 'O-Ring aging' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches closely with multiple failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase'. The function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system' and failure effect 'Oil leakage to environment' are consistent across these contexts. Although the product is a different engine version (Type 6 vs Type 4), both belong to the same product category (gas engines), share the same subsystem and system element, and similar preventive/detective measures exist (supplier involvement, design to specification, tolerance control, maintenance schedule, leakage tests, endurance runs, assembly and functional tests). Thus, the retrieved data can be used as a baseline with small adjustments reflecting advances or potential differences in the newer engine. The severity rating for oil leakage to environment is stable at 7 in the retrieved data (matching the failure effect significance as 'process disturbance, problems for some customers' up to 'reduced service, customers dissatisfied') - consistent with definition for environmental leakage concerns. Occurrence ratings for O-Ring aging as a cause are generally reported as 2-3 (low to occasional) depending on specific failure mode context; given the preventive measures are comprehensive and properly applied, occurrence rating 3 is appropriate here consistent with retrieved data. Detection ratings for O-Ring aging failure cause combined with this failure mode range mostly around 4 (high likelihood of detection via tests and inspections prior to delivery), supported by thorough leakage and endurance tests listed. Given the detective measures match closely, detection rating 4 is best fit. Overall, no major contextual factors in Type 6 suggest needing higher or lower risk ratings beyond those established in Type 4. This approach leverages closely related historical FMEA knowledge adapted suitably for the new but similar system."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),Oil leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element with failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment over time' caused by 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' and failure effect 'Oil leakage to environment'. The retrieved exact match data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with highly similar subsystem, system element, failure mode, cause, effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. Both deal with Oil leakage to environment over time due to maintenance issues, with 'Maintenance Plan and Instruction' as preventive and 'Crankcase pressure monitoring' and 'Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring' as detective measures. Severity matches failure effect definition (rated 4) indicating process disturbance without severe regulatory or financial impact. Occurrence is rated 2, reflecting unlikely occurrence given existing maintenance plans. Detection is rated 4, indicating high likelihood of detection prior to customer impact through pressure monitoring. Considering very close system similarity, identical measures, and matching failure effect impact, I adapt the retrieved ratings with confidence to the Gas Engine Type 6 context without change."
O-Ring material selection,Oil: contamination of the environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target FMEA scenario (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, Contact to cylinder head assembly function, failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase', failure cause 'O-Ring material selection', and failure effect 'Oil: contamination of the environment') exactly matches a retrieved FMEA entry for Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. The product category (Gas Engine) and functional context are consistent, allowing direct use of retrieved ratings. The preventive measures (Supplier recommendation, O-Ring calculation, O-Ring specification / Material selection) and detective measures (Leakage test, Endurance run (Leakage check)) are the same and assessed as effective, justifying the occurrence rating of 2 (unlikely) and detection rating of 2 (certain detection in subsequent processes). The severity rating of 7 reflects significant environmental contamination causing customer dissatisfaction or regulatory impact consistent with contamination of oil to the environment for this engine type. No contextual adjustment is needed."
Material plasticity,Oil: contamination of the environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 is highly relevant: same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), identical function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), same failure mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), same failure cause (Material plasticity), and same failure effect (Oil: contamination of the environment). Both product types are gas engines with similar operational environments, so the severity rating and failure effects on the environment and customer are analogous. Preventive measures are the same (FEA, Material measurement FPQ, Fuji film test, Material characterization/qualification), and detective measures are highly comparable though the target system lists extra detective measures like Bolt extension check test and Vibration measurement — these suggest at least the same or slightly improved detection capability. Occurrence rating of 3 in Gas Engine Type 4 was based on these preventive controls which seem similarly effective in Gas Engine Type 6 context. Severity of 7 reflects a significant environmental contamination impact causing customer dissatisfaction or regulatory concern, fitting the described failure effect. Detection rating in Gas Engine Type 4 was 6 (detection only through targeted inspection). The target system's expanded detective tests (added Bolt extension check test, Vibration measurement) could slightly improve detection capability, but given detection still relies on focused, possibly destructive or specialized tests, it remains appropriate to keep detection rating at 6. Occurrence remains at 3 considering preventive measures’ effectiveness and no indication of increased failure likelihood. Therefore, adapted ratings are Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=6, consistent and justified within similar functional and product context with slight detection measure adjustments but maintaining conservative detection rating due to no fundamental improvement in detection certainty."
O-ring aging,Oil: contamination of the environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and the retrieved data system (Gas Engine Type 4) belong to the same product category (gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), failure cause (O-ring aging), and failure effect (Oil: contamination of the environment) match exactly. Preventive and detective measures are very similar. Therefore, base ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 data are highly relevant. Minor adaptation is considered due to potential slight design improvements or operational differences in newer Gas Engine Type 6 which could marginally reduce occurrence but detection measures remain the same. Severity is assumed unchanged since the failure effect (environmental oil contamination) impact is consistent across engines. Hence, Severity=7, Occurrence=2 (low likelihood due to good preventive controls), Detection=5 (requires targeted inspection/endurance and field validation leakage inspections)."
"Combustion system ""high pfp events""",Oil: contamination of the environment,"EXACT_MATCH due to identical context in product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), failure cause (Combustion system 'high pfp events'), failure effect (Oil: contamination of the environment), and preventive and detective measures. The existing ratings Severity=7, Occurrence=4, Detection=4 align well with the given measures and failure effect impact according to the rating definitions."
Bolted joint design,Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved FMEA data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' shares the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), failure mode ('Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase') and failure cause ('Bolted joint design') as the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Preventive and detective measures are identical. Given the direct alignment of failure parameters and measures, the main difference is the engine type version. Slight possible differences in operating conditions or design maturity could adjust ratings slightly, but given the complexity and robust preventive measures (FEA, VDI 2230 standards, detailed design processes) and active detection (Bolted joint pre-load measurement), original ratings are largely applicable. The severity of 7 aligns well with a reduced combustion efficiency impacting customer satisfaction (reduced service). Occurrence is occasional (4) reflecting sound preventive design effort but residual risk. Detection is high likelihood (3) since bolted joint preload measurement effectively detects issues before delivery. Considering that target system is a later engine type and the measures are comprehensive and the failure impact is similar, no rating adjustment is warranted. Thus, ratings from the closely matching context are directly applied."
O-Ring material selection,Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, Contact to cylinder head assembly, Failure Mode: Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase, Failure Cause: O-Ring material selection, Failure Effect: Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure) exactly matches retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem, component, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. The product category (gas engines) and functional context are consistent. Preventive measures ('Supplier recommendation', 'O-Ring calculation', 'O-Ring specification / Material selection') and detective measures ('Leakage test', 'Endurance run (Leakage check)') are exactly the same, indicating comparable effectiveness in risk mitigation and detection capability. The retrieved ratings are Severity=7, Occurrence=2, Detection=2, which align with the failure effect severity on combustion efficiency (rated 7 for reduced service/customer dissatisfaction), a low likelihood of occurrence due to strong preventive controls, and high likelihood of detection due to effective leakage and endurance tests. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Material plasticity,Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 shows a perfect match for subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), failure cause (Material plasticity), and failure effect (Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure). The preventive and detective measures are identical to the target system. The main difference is engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4), which likely implies some evolutionary changes but within the same product category and similar functional context. Because engine type changes rarely drastically alter sealing material plasticity failure criticality or the effectiveness of existing preventive and detective measures for this specific failure cause and effect, the retrieved ratings are applicable with minimal adjustment. Severity rating of 7 is consistent, reflecting reduced engine combustion efficiency but no regulation violation or catastrophic failure. Occurrence rating of 3 aligns with moderate likelihood given preventive measures (FEA, FPQ, Fuji film test, material characterization). Detection rating of 6 reflects that detection occurs only via targeted inspections (Overload test, Endurance run, Bolt extension check, Vibration measurement), matching the described detective measures and their typical detection certainty for this cause/mode. Thus, the existing ratings are applicable with no change."
O-ring aging,Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode, cause, effect, product category, subsystem, system element, and function match exactly to the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block', 'Crankcase', 'Contact to cylinder head assembly' with failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' caused by 'O-ring aging' and effect 'Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure'. Preventive and detective measures also match exactly. Due to strong similarity (same product category, core system element, failure mode, cause, effect, and measures), the risk ratings from the retrieved data can be used directly without adjustment. Severity is well justified as 7, reflecting reduced service and customer dissatisfaction from lowered combustion efficiency. Occurrence is considered low (2) due to effective preventive measures like supplier recommendations and design practices. Detection is moderate (5) consistent with reliance on endurance run and field leakage inspections, which may not guarantee early detection but can identify failures before wide customer impact."
"Combustion system ""high pfp events""",Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure,"EXACT_MATCH based on product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), failure cause (Combustion system ""high pfp events""), and failure effect (Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure) matching exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. Preventive and detective measures are identical. Hence, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Bolted joint design,Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' caused by 'Bolted joint design' resulting in 'Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure'. The retrieved closest match is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, and having identical preventive and detective measures. Despite the difference in engine type (Type 6 vs. Type 4), both are gas engines within the same product category and share highly similar design and operating contexts. Preventive measures such as FEA, VDI 2230, DP49 - Bolted joint, and others, are identical and robust. Detective measure of bolted joint pre-load measurement is the same. Therefore, the severity rating remains consistent at 7, reflecting reduced service and customer dissatisfaction due to overheating causing component failure. The occurrence rating of 4 ('occasional occurrence') is appropriate considering effective but not fail-safe preventive measures. Detection rating of 3 (high likelihood of detection through subsequent process measurement) fits the existing detective measure. Minor engine differences may imply slight contextual variations but no significant change in risk profile. Hence, no adjustment to ratings is needed beyond reaffirming their applicability to the new engine type."
O-Ring material selection,Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on close matching context from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6 in the same Product Category and identical Subsystem, SystemElement, Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, Failure Effect, and identical Preventive and Detective measures. The minor version difference (Type 4 to Type 6) within Gas Engines does not materially impact the failure consequence or control effectiveness, so the retrieved ratings are fully applicable without adjustment."
O-ring aging,Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data is for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both are gas engine products within the same product category with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), failure cause (O-ring aging), and failure effect (Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure). Preventive and detective measures also strongly overlap. Considering similarities, the risk ratings from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are directly relevant. Minor adjustments could be considered for potential incremental design improvements or aging changes in Type 6; however, no contradictory information or major changes in measures indicate a need to revise ratings significantly. Severity is consistent at 7 due to overheating causing component failure, a serious but not regulatory-violative impact. Occurrence is low (2), reflecting strong preventive controls via supplier and design specifications. Detection is moderate (5), since detection occurs only through endurance runs and field validations, not during assembly or immediate testing, indicating moderate probability of detection before customer impact."
"Combustion system ""high pfp events""",Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 matches perfectly the target context in terms of Product Category (Gas Engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Contact to cylinder head assembly), Failure Mode (Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase), Failure Cause (Combustion system ""high pfp events""), Failure Effect (Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure) and the exact preventive and detective measures are the same ('Bolted joint design practice', 'Cylinder head design practice' and 'Cylinder head pulse rig test', 'Bolt extension test (MCE)'). This constitutes an exact match allowing direct usage of the retrieved ratings. 

Severity is rated 7, indicating reduced service/customers dissatisfied due to overheating causing component failure. The occurrence of 4 indicates occasional occurrence considering the preventive measures, and detection rating 4 shows a high likelihood of detection in subsequent tests. These ratings align well with the technical scenario and existing measures, so no adjustment is needed."
Cylinder head alignment strategy,Gas leakage through cylinder head gasket -> gas in the room and efficiency decrease,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Product 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows an exact match with the target context 'Gas Engine Type 6' for subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Contact to cylinder head assembly', failure mode 'Incorrect alignment', failure cause 'Cylinder head alignment strategy', and failure effect 'Gas leakage through cylinder head gasket -> gas in the room and efficiency decrease'. The preventive and detective measures ('DP42 - Cylinder head', 'Material specification', 'Tolerance stack up' for prevention and 'Assembly test', 'MCE test' for detection) are identical to those described in the target system, indicating same effectiveness level of controls. Severity is rated as 10 due to gas leakage causing hazardous gas presence in the room and loss of combustion efficiency, which represents regulatory violation and potential financial damage. Occurrence is rated 2 - Unlikely, reflecting effective preventive measures in place. Detection is rated 2 - certain detection, reflecting high capability of assembly and MCE testing to detect issue prior to delivery. Therefore, the exact match data is fully applicable without adjustment."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Engine misfiring,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' regarding the 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Crankcase' system element and function, same failure mode ('Too low gas intake to cylinder head'), failure cause ('Intake manifold and V-room design'), and failure effect ('Engine misfiring'). Preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved data are the same or very close to those in the target system (same supplier recommendations, FEA, CFD, external consultation, simulation; and performance tests, thermal survey). Therefore, risk ratings (Severity=6, Occurrence=9, Detection=4) can be used directly as they fit the context and the effectiveness of preventive/detective measures."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Too low gas intake to cylinder head), failure cause (Intake manifold and V-room design), and failure effect (Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output). The preventive and detective measures in the target context align very closely or are more extensive, indicating that the occurrence rating should be at least as high, and detection rating can be reliably applied from the retrieved data. Severity rating is consistent since the failure effect and customer impact are the same."
Deposit in intake system,Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 matching target system context (Product Category, Subsystem, System Element, Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect). The failure mode 'Too low gas intake to cylinder head' caused by 'Deposit in intake system' with preventive measure 'Selection of gas quality requirements' and detective measures 'Endurance run (performance degradation)' and 'Field validation (performance degradation)' are identical. Severity rating of 6 aligns with impact on combustion efficiency and power loss. Occurrence rated at 2 reflects low likelihood due to preventive gas quality control. Detection rated at 2 denotes certain detection in subsequent endurance and field validations. Ratings are consistent and fit the current measures and system context; thus, direct usage of retrieved ratings is appropriate."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' while the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase/V-room area), function (directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation'), failure cause ('V-room design'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). These match well in system element identity and functional context, although the product type has a minor version difference. Preventive and detective measures are very similar or the same (e.g., 1d simulation, RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specification, FEA Simulation for preventive and multiple MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation for detection), suggesting similar controls' effectiveness. Severity in retrieved data is rated 5, reflecting a moderate process disturbance/problem for some customers due to performance drop—appropriate for engine performance loss. Occurrence is 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting that despite measures, the inherent design limitation of the V-room can lead to this cause occasionally. Detection is 2 (certain detection in subsequent processes) due to comprehensive functional testing and validation plans in place. Given the strong similarity and consistent preventive/detective measures, we adopt these ratings directly without adjustment."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' shares the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem ('Engine Block') with the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' matches exactly, as does the failure cause 'Material selection' and the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Although the system element differs ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'), both components functionally relate to directing/leading air/gas mixture to the cylinder head assembly, and failure cause related to material selection appears consistent. Preventive and detective measures are effectively the same or very similar, and customer impact (performance drop) is consistent. Severity rating of 5 from the retrieved data fits the described failure effect impact on engine performance and customer expectation (process disturbance/problems for some customers). Occurrence rating of 5 is justified given that the preventive measures listed are similar and existing but failure cause (material selection) is known to have occasional occurrence risk. Detection rating of 4 reflects a high likelihood of detection during functional testing and validations before the product delivery. Given the close match of failure mode, cause, effect, product category, preventive and detective measures, the existing ratings are applicable with no adjustment needed for the target context."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', with system element 'Crankcase' and failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'Design for maintenance', resulting in 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows very close failure mode, cause, and effect but differs slightly in system element (V-room insulation vs Crankcase). Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (engine block) with the same function context (air/gas/mixture flow to cylinder). Preventive and detective measures are largely identical or highly overlapping in concept and scope. Severity rating 5 aligns well since engine performance drop is comparable for crankcase and V-room insulation. Occurrence rating is 5 in retrieved data reflecting occasional occurrence given the design guideline preventive measure; maintainability design guidelines are similar in preventive impact. Detection rating is 5 in retrieved data based on various validation and functional testing techniques, matching target measures. Slight adjustment is considered due to target system element being core crankcase (more central than V-room insulation), possibly increasing detectability slightly due to more direct monitoring, but since measures are robust including field combustion monitoring and assembly trials, detection remains rated as 5 consistent with similar context. Overall, direct reuse with minor reasoning adjustment confirms ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are appropriate for Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase context."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in the 'Crankcase' component of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches the retrieved failure mode in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same failure mode, cause, and effect but associated with the 'V-room insulation' component. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) with same functional role related to supplying air/gas mixture to cylinder head assembly. Preventive and detective measures largely overlap, including 'Requirement specification for combustion events', '1d simulation', 'RAIP', and multiple functional and field validation testings. Given this high similarity but slight difference in component within same subsystem (Crankcase vs V-room insulation), the severity rating remains consistent at 5, reflecting a moderate impact of performance drop. Occurrence rating of 5 from the retrieved data holds, reflecting occasional occurrence despite preventive measures. Detection rating is also kept at 4, indicative of high likelihood of detection via functional and field testing implemented. No major contextual change requiring adjustment is found, thus retrieved ratings are adapted with confirmation to target context."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares an almost identical failure mode, cause, effect, and preventive/detective measures with the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The key difference is the slight evolution in product generation (Type 4 vs Type 6) but within the same product category (gas engines) and the same subsystem (Engine Block - Crankcase/V-room functions). The preventive and detective measures are nearly identical, implying similar effectiveness. The failure effect severity remains process disturbance causing performance drop rated at severity 5 in the retrieved data, which aligns well with the described failure effect and customer impact thus can be directly adopted. Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence) reflects residual risk after preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection during functional/performance testing before shipment) also fits the described detective measures. Hence, minor adjustment is unnecessary, and the retrieved ratings apply. Consistency with related failure modes and causes in the same context supports this application."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase directing gas flow to cylinder head, with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' caused by 'V-room design' and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data with exact matching failure mode, cause, and effect exists for 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', component 'V-room insulation' with Severity=5, Occurrence=5, Detection=2, and similar preventive/detective measures. Given the product category (gas engines) and subsystem context are the same, but the product type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), possibly representing evolutionary design improvements but retaining core function and design controls, the existing ratings are highly applicable. Small contextual differences may influence occurrence slightly due to potential design improvements in Type 6; however, preventive measures remain very similar and thorough. Detection measures are also consistent and robust, reflecting high likelihood of finding failure before customer impact. Severity aligns with the performance drop on customer (engine end user) and remains appropriately moderate (5). Therefore, the retrieved ratings are adopted with no changes. This maintains consistency and reflects operational similarity with reliable preventive and detective controls."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', element 'Crankcase', with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', caused by 'Material selection' and effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows an exact failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' with the same failure cause 'Material selection' causing the same effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Preventive and detective measures are highly overlapping and comparable in sophistication and scope. The product categories, subsystems, and functional elements are closely related gas engines, differing only by type number, which likely means minor design evolution but similar operating and failure environments. Severity rating of 5 from retrieved data matches the moderate impact of performance drop without regulatory or severe financial damage. Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence with existing preventive measures like simulations and specifications) is appropriate given the similar preventive controls. Detection rating of 4 (high detection likelihood in subsequent testing and field validation) fits the detailed functional and component level testing described for both contexts. Therefore, ratings from the retrieved similar context are applicable with no adjustment, ensuring consistency and reflecting the similarity in measures and environment."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' with failure cause 'Design for maintenance' and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely similar to the retrieved data for the same failure mode, cause, and effect in the 'V-room insulation' component of 'Gas Engine Type 4', which is in the same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem context (Engine Block), and same function of directing/leads air/gas mixture to the cylinder head. Although the subsystem and system element differ (Crankcase vs V-room insulation), the functional role and failure impact on gas flow and performance are analogous. Preventive measures such as 'Design guideline (maintainability)' and the validation plans have strong overlap and relevance. The occurrence and detection ratings in the reference case are moderate (Occurrence=5, Detection=5), reflecting occasional failures despite reasonable preventive and detection measures. 

Adjustments are minimal as the new context (Crankcase) is at a similar system level with possibly similar complexity and criticality for gas flow. The severity remains consistent at 5, as the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' is identical and rated 5 previously and also fits the impact range (4-6: process disturbance, some customer problems).

Occurrence remains at 5, as the preventive measures are comparable in effectiveness, and occasional design-for-maintenance related issues remain plausible.

Detection remains at 5 because the detective measures listed are comprehensive but require targeted inspections and functional testing to detect the failure cause before customer impact.

Thus, the ratings from the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' V-room insulation are appropriate and applicable with minimal adjustment for the current 'Gas Engine Type 6' Crankcase scenario."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', caused by 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)', and effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' with the same failure cause and failure effect exists. Although the product type differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), the product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect match well. Preventive and detective measures overlap strongly between target and retrieved data, indicating similar control effectiveness. The severity rating should remain consistent at 5 since the impact is the same. Occurrence rating also aligns with existing preventive measures and is low (2). Detection rating differs slightly (retrieved data shows Detection 5 for target failure mode and cause, while a similar related failure cause in the retrieved data has detection 4), but considering the detective measures listed for the target, Detection 5 (detection only by targeted inspection) is appropriate, matching the retrieved data specific to 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'. Hence, ratings from the similar context are adapted with verification of current measures and no significant differences found to warrant deviation."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly', failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)', failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. The retrieved closest match is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', but with system element 'V-room insulation' and the same failure mode, cause, effect, and similar preventive and detective measures. Both reside in the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem, with very similar functional context but different system element (V-room vs Crankcase). Preventive and detective measures overlap strongly. The severity rating of 5 in retrieved data aligns well with a moderate performance drop in engine block gas flow disturbance. Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence) fits the transient engine operation cause with current preventive specification measures. Detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) is supported by the extensive functional testing and validation plans in place. The Crankcase, as a core air/gas directing element similar in function to the V-room insulation, is expected to have risk ratings very close to the retrieved data, slightly favoring the same values due to similar risk management maturity. Hence, adopting the retrieved ratings from V-room insulation failure mode with no adjustment needed is appropriate due to very similar context and measures, except acknowledging the system element difference by explicitly noting the decision as SIMILAR_CONTEXT rather than EXACT_MATCH."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved closest match is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' at the subsystem 'Engine Block' but in 'V-room insulation' with the same failure mode, failure cause ('Combustion system'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). Both share the same product category (gas engines) and functional context (gas flow to cylinder head). Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical. Differences involve the specific component (Crankcase vs. V-room insulation) with similar function of directing the air/gas mixture, so impact severity and risk controls are comparable but may differ slightly in detection challenges due to component specifics. Given this, severity remains consistent at 5 (process disturbance / problems for some customers). Occurrence remains at 5 considering identical preventive measures and failure causes. Detection rating is adapted slightly: retrieved detection is 4 for V-room insulation, while the Crankcase may have equal or slightly better detection due to strong validation and functional testing presence; therefore, detection rating is maintained at 4. Overall, ratings are consistent with existing measures and technical understanding."
Bolted joint design,Oil leakage to environment due to compromised sealing interface of crankcase to CCV system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Lack of sealing' at the crankcase to CCV (blow-by) system interface in Gas Engine Type 6 closely matches the context of 'Degradation of sealing over time' and 'Oil leakage over time' failure modes at crankcase and crankcase-related sealing interfaces in Gas Engine Type 4, same product category and subsystem with consistent preventive and detective measures (e.g. FEA, VDI 2230, bolted joint calculations, bolted joint pre-load measurement). The failure cause 'Bolted joint design' is rated with occurrence 3 (low likelihood) due to extensive preventive measures (FEA, standards, simulations). The target failure effect 'Oil leakage to environment' aligns with severity ratings of 7 (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction) from similar leaks causing environmental oil leakage and operational impact but not regulatory breach or catastrophic failure. Detection is rated 3 corresponding to high likelihood of detection via bolted joint preload measurement and assembly test, consistent with retrieved data. Minor contextual difference to Type 6 engine does not materially affect ratings due to equivalent design and test rigor."
Liquid sealing degradation caused by chemical or thermal aging,Oil leakage to environment from deteriorated sealing materials,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Lack of sealing' in the crankcase contacting the CCV (blow-by) system, caused by liquid sealing degradation due to chemical or thermal aging, leading to oil leakage to environment. Although no exact match was found for Gas Engine Type 6, highly similar failure modes and contexts were found in Gas Engine Type 4 related to Engine Block subsystem, crankcase elements, sealing degradation, and oil leakage to environment. The retrieved failure modes such as 'Oil leakage over time', 'Degradation of sealing over time', and 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' closely match in terms of component, failure cause (sealing aging/degradation), and failure effect (oil leakage to environment). Preventive and detective measures overlap strongly with those in the Type 4 data (e.g., sealant specs, design per specification, supplier involvement, tolerances, endurance runs, field validation). Hence, applying and cautiously adapting these ratings to the Type 6 context is appropriate.

Severity: Retrieved severity ratings for oil leakage to environment from sealing degradation are consistently rated as 7, indicating customer dissatisfaction and environmental impact but no regulation violation.

Occurrence: The occurrence for 'Liquid sealing degradation' or 'O-Ring aging' is rated 2-3 in Type 4 with preventive measures similar to the target. Given the target includes solid design life alignment with maintenance schedules and supplier involvement, occurrence is best rated as 2 (Unlikely) reflecting effective preventive measures.

Detection: Detection ratings for similar causes by 'Endurance run' and 'Field validation' are typically 4 or 5 (high likelihood of detection or detection through targeted inspection). Since detective measures match well and include both endurance run and field validation, detection rating of 5 is appropriate, considering some failures may only be detected through targeted inspections.

Final ratings are adapted slightly lower occurrence reflecting effective preventive design in the newer Type 6 engine but keeping detection consistent due to similar test processes and failure detection complexity."
Assembly process errors or insufficient design for assembly readiness causing sealing faults or gaps,Blow-by gas and oil leakage to environment resulting in emission and contamination,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode is 'Leakage of blow-by gas' due to 'Assembly process errors or insufficient design for assembly readiness causing sealing faults or gaps' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. There are no exact matches for Gas Engine Type 6, but multiple very similar failure modes with matching failure mode and cause exist in Gas Engine Type 4 within Engine Block subsystem, related to CCV system or crankcase sealing. The retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 shows 'Leakage of blow-by gas' or 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' with assembly process/design for assembly as failure causes, and sealing leakage effects with severity rated at 4 or 5, occurrence mostly rated 5 (occasional), and detection ranging 4 to 6 depending on cause and test methods. However, the target context has stronger preventive measures explicitly involving detailed assembly instructions, sensor specs, RAIP, production and controls team involvement, and extensive detective measures including trials, checklists, testbenches, endurance runs, field validations with crankcase pressure monitoring—this indicates improved detection and preventive effectiveness compared to the Gas Engine Type 4 context. Severity: The failure effect is 'Blow-by gas and oil leakage to environment causing emissions and contamination', which implies regulatory non-compliance risk and environmental contamination beyond mere operational inconvenience. Gas Engine Type 4 leakage modes are rated severity 4 for oil/blow-by leakage or 5 for blow-by gas leakage to environment. Given emissions and contamination present here, severity should be elevated to 6 (process disturbance and problems for some customers, including possible regulatory scrutiny) but not full 9-10 since no direct evidence of regulatory violation as in high THC emissions is provided. Occurrence: Given the mature preventive measures, but assembly causes still relevant, occurrence is consistent with 'occasional occurrence' rated 5. Detection: The extensive multi-layer detective measures (leakage tests, assembly trials, checklists, pressure monitoring, field validations) suggest a better detection capability compared to Type 4 assemblies (which rate detection 6). Detection rating should be lowered (better detection) to 4 (high likelihood of detection prior to customer delivery). This accounts for assembly and commissioning checkpoints proactively identifying leakage. Overall, this SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating adapts from Type 4 data but improves detection rating due to more comprehensive detector systems and more stringent assembly control in Type 6 context. Hence, Severity = 6, Occurrence = 5, Detection = 4 is appropriate and consistent."
Crankcase design shortcomings such as improper sealing surface or tolerances,Blow-by gas leakage increasing environmental pollution and system inefficiency,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in 'CCV (blow-by) system' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' engine block and crankcase design cause. The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase contacting CCV system with failure mode of blow-by gas leakage and failure cause being crankcase design shortcomings. The retrieved data shows identical failure mode and cause concept, same subsystem, system element identity (crankcase), and product category (gas engine). Similar preventive measures and detective measures listed confirm consistency of context. Severity for failure effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' is rated as 4, indicating a moderate environmental and inefficiency impact without regulatory violation or critical financial loss. Occurrence rating is given as 6 due to known design shortcomings with existing preventive measures that reduce but do not eliminate likelihood. Detection rating is 5 with the available daily functional and field tests providing moderate but not complete detection reliability prior to customer impact. Thus, ratings are adopted directly from exact matching data."
CCV (blow-by) system design flaws including interface mismatches or improper routing,Blow-by gas leakage and potential performance degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem crankcase interface to the CCV system. Retrieved data shows this failure mode in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with a very close match in subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('CCV (blow-by) system design flaws including interface mismatches or improper routing'), and failure effect ('Blow-by gas leakage and potential performance degradation'). The product category (gas engines), subsystem context, and failure cause are consistent. Preventive and detective measures listed are effectively identical (FEA simulation, cable guidelines, sensor specifications, functional and field testing, pressure monitoring). Thus, retrieved ratings are directly applicable but minor adjustment needed for severity due to slight terminology and product generation difference, maintaining consistency with severity levels for similar environmental and customer impact. Severity in retrieved data for related failure effects is 4 (oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment) or 5 (blow-by leakage causing damage to secondary components) for crankcase sealing components with high severity if secondary damage occurs. Since the target failure specifically notes potential performance degradation but not confirmed damage, a conservative severity of 4 is consistent and appropriate. Occurrence rating for 'CCV system design' cause in similar cases is 3 due to effective preventive measures, reflecting low likelihood. Detection rating is consistently 2 reflecting good detection capability via vibration measurement and functional testing plus pressure monitoring. Hence, severity = 4, occurrence = 3, detection = 2 are assigned, reflecting effective preventive and detective measures with low risk but non-negligible impact. No higher severity (7-8 or 9-10) is justified because no regulatory or significant financial damage or customer dissatisfaction is implied. This falls well in the 'process disturbance, problems for some customers' severity range. Overall, the ratings reflect a sound, consistent FMEA evaluation based on highly similar historical data adapted fittingly for the target system context."
Piping design issues causing improper sealing or mechanical stresses,Leakage of blow-by gases affecting emission compliance and system integrity,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in crankcase piping design causing emission compliance and system integrity effects. Retrieved data mainly from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with very similar subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), failure mode (Leakage of blow-by gas), and failure cause (Piping design causing improper sealing). The context differs slightly due to engine type difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) but within the same product category and functional context, so ratings can be adapted. The failure effect severity in Type 4 is rated 4 (Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment), but the target description emphasizes impact on emission compliance and system integrity, which is more severe than mere leakage to environment. Emission compliance violation typically rates severity at 9 or above, but no direct exact match for emissions cause leakage from crankcase piping was found, only indirect (high THC emissions related to liner gasket at 9 severity). Given blow-by gas leakage affecting emission compliance and system integrity (important regulatory/financial aspect), a severity rating of 7 is a balanced elevation from the retrieved 4, reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and regulatory impact but not necessarily immediate legal violation or catastrophic failure. Occurrence rating for 'Piping design' cause with preventive measures (FEA Simulation, GASENGDP048 Piping) is consistently 3 in retrieved data, indicating low likelihood given existing effective preventive measures. As no additional risk factors indicate increased likelihood, occurrence rating is retained at 3. Detection rating for 'Piping design' cause with existing detective measures (MCE Vibration/modal test, Field Validation vibration monitoring, Functional Testing, Pressure Monitoring) is consistently 4 in retrieved examples, indicating high likelihood of detection before delivery. As these detection measures are active and effective, detection rating is kept at 4. Thus, adapting ratings from closely similar context with analytical reasoning leads to Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 for the target context."
Aging of O-Rings reducing elasticity and sealing capability,Gradual increase in blow-by gas escape leading to environmental emissions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, with failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' caused by 'Aging of O-Rings reducing elasticity and sealing capability' leading to 'Gradual increase in blow-by gas escape leading to environmental emissions'. Retrieved data shows a closely similar failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' in Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, CCV or Crankcase components, caused by 'O-Ring aging' with occurrence rating 3 and detection rating 4 to 6 depending on failure mode context. Preventive and detective measures in target are equivalent or more comprehensive, including supplier involvement, design to specs, maintenance plans, multiple testing and inspection methods, aligning well with the Type 4 context. Severity ratings for blow-by gas leakage to environment cluster around 4-5 for minor environmental emission, except for higher ratings (7+) for oil leaks. Since the failure effect is specifically environmental emissions increasing gradually (blow-by gas), severity 5 is consistent with similar failure effect ratings in Type 4 data. Occurrence rating 3 is consistent with effective preventive measures implemented. Detection rating 4 (leakage test, endurance run inspection, visual inspection) matches similar detection ratings for O-ring aging causes in Type 4 data, showing moderate detection likelihood before customer impact. Hence, adaptation of Type 4 ratings applies directly with slight contextual considerations due to same product category (gas engine), same subsystem and system element, same failure mode and cause, but different engine type (6 vs 4). No contradictory evidence or significant difference in preventive/detective measures strength to increase or decrease ratings substantially. Therefore, Severity=5, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 are appropriate and consistent with the retrieved data and context."
"Maintenance neglect of oil, filter, or oil level affecting sealing integrity",Progressive blow-by gas leakage reducing engine performance and compliance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase leakage of blow-by gas due to maintenance neglect matches closely to multiple retrieved failure records from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and failure mode ('Leakage of blow-by gas' or 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time') with the same failure cause (maintenance neglect of oil, filter, or oil level affecting sealing integrity) and similar effects (progressive blow-by gas leakage reducing engine performance and compliance). The preventive measure 'Maintenance Plan and Instruction' and detective measures 'Crankcase pressure monitoring' and 'Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring' are identical. Differences in engine type versions may slightly impact occurrence or detection, but given same product category and subsystem, differences are minor. Severity ratings for similar failure effects in the retrieved data are consistently rated 4 (oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment) which fits the described impact of progressive performance decrease and compliance issues without regulatory or major financial damage. Occurrence is rated as 2, indicating unlikely occurrence due to maintenance plan but still possible with neglect. Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) consistent with pressure monitoring systems in place. Thus, ratings from the similar context 'Gas Engine Type 4' can be applied with confidence to 'Gas Engine Type 6' with no adjustment needed."
"Transient engine operational conditions (startup, cooldown) causing material movement or deformation",Crankcase overpressure risking seal failure and system damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' caused by 'Transient engine operational conditions (startup, cooldown) causing material movement or deformation' in Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase is closely similar to the retrieved failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' (and 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter over time') in Gas Engine Type 4 in the CCV (blow-by) system within the Engine Block subsystem and involving crankcase ventilation function. Preventive and detective measures in both contexts are highly aligned and comprehensive, focusing on simulation, design adherence, modal analysis, pressure monitoring, vibration testing, and field validations, indicating comparable control effectiveness. The only difference is a slight product version difference (Type 4 vs. Type 6) which is within the same product category and functional context. The retrieved severity rating for the associated failure effect 'Crankcase overpressure risking seal failure and system damage' is consistently 4, categorizing it as process disturbance with potential problems for some customers without regulatory violations or major financial damage. The occurrence rating in retrieved data for failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' is 5, representing occasional occurrence despite preventive measures in place, which matches the described comprehensive preventive measures here as well. Detection rating is 4 in the retrieved context for this cause and failure mode, representing high likelihood of detection through the existing monitoring and testing measures before customer delivery. Therefore, the risk ratings are directly applicable with no adjustment needed."
Crankcase design limitations failing to withstand pressure spikes,Crankcase leakage and potential oil contamination outside system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' with failure cause 'Crankcase design' and failure effect 'Crankcase leakage and potential oil contamination outside system' exactly matches a failure mode in retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 (similar product, same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'Crankcase', same failure mode, cause and effect). Preventive and detective measures are also aligned (O-Ring and sealing specification, Crankcase Ventilation System, Proof of Concept Test, MCE Functional Testing, pressure monitoring). Rating adaptation considers the new target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', a likely advancement with potentially improved designs and measures, so minimal adjustment is needed but slight improvement in detection due to possible enhancements in monitoring is reasonable. Severity is kept consistent with effect impact at 4 (process disturbance with some customer problems). Occurrence remains at 6 (occasional occurrence despite preventive measures), aligned with retrieved data. Detection is adapted slightly better from 5 to 4 considering enhanced functional and field testing measures available in the newer system, enabling a higher likelihood of failure detection before customer impact."
O-Ring aging and degradation,Progressive oil leakage impacting engine lubrication and environmental contamination,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment over time' caused by 'O-Ring aging and degradation' in the crankcase within the engine block subsystem. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same product category and similar subsystem (Engine Block) and system element (Crankcase) provide directly relevant and very close context around 'O-Ring aging' causing sealing degradation and oil leakage with prescribed preventive and detective measures which align well with the target's existing measures. The failure effect severity ratings for oil leakage to environment are consistently rated as 7 or 9 across 'Leakage crankcase (outside) over time' and 'Degradation of sealing over time' failure modes, with environmental contamination and lubrication impairment considered. Given the similarity, the retrieved severity of 7 (oil leak into environment with impact on engine lubrication and environmental contamination) is appropriate. Occurrence ratings in the retrieved data for 'O-Ring aging' with similar preventive measures cluster around 3 (low to occasional likelihood) reflecting effectiveness of design involvement, specification and maintenance-aligned design life, which matches the target's preventive measures. Detection ratings are around 4 (high likelihood of detection pre-delivery via leakage and endurance testing), consistent with target detective measures including Leakage test, Endurance run inspections, Assembly test, and MCE testbench tests. No major context environmental or customer impact differences suggest rating adjustments. Therefore, severity rating of 7, occurrence rating of 3, and detection rating of 4 are recommended for this target failure mode and cause."
Design for maintenance inadequacies restricting access or complex assembly,High maintenance efforts increasing downtime and cost,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Poor serviceability' on the 'Crankcase' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem related to 'Design for maintenance' failure cause impacting CCV interface. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact subsystem, system element, and failure mode but different product generation is highly similar context. The failure effect corresponds clearly to 'High service effort' or 'High maintenance efforts increasing downtime and cost' with severity rated as 5 in the retrieved data. Preventive and detective measures in retrieved data match those in target context exactly ('GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System' and 'Maintenance plan and instruction' preventive; multiple functional and pressure monitoring tests detective). Occurrence rating is 3 in the similar context reflecting moderate but controlled likelihood with current prevention. Detection rating is 2 indicating high likelihood of detection through existing diagnostic and monitoring methods before customer impact. Considering potential slight differences in product generation and possibly incremental improvements but essentially the same system and measures, no adjustment is warranted. Thus, it is appropriate to adopt the retrieved ratings directly for target context with rationale: same failure cause and effect, preventive/detective measures aligned, product category and subsystem identical with minor generation difference only."
Assembly process complexity leading to difficult repairs or inspections,Extended maintenance windows and reduced system availability,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is very close to retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Crankcase'), function ('Contact to CCV system'), failure mode ('Poor serviceability'), failure cause ('Assembly process complexity leading to difficult repairs or inspections'), and failure effect ('Extended maintenance windows and reduced system availability' roughly mapped to 'High service effort'). Preventive and detective measures match closely. The retrieved data for failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' in similar failure modes includes occurrence rating 5 and detection rating 4, with severity rating around 5 for related poor serviceability effects. Given the operational similarity and stable preventive/detective measures, these ratings are applicable with no adjustments needed for the slightly newer engine type. Severity rated 5 corresponds to 'Process disturbance, problems for some customers' which fits the described extended maintenance and reduced availability impact. Occurrence rating 5 reflects 'occasional occurrence' acknowledging assembly complexity despite controls. Detection rating 4 indicates 'high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes' consistent with assembly trial and commissioning checklist usage. Thus, adopting these ratings meets the target system risk rating objectives and rating definitions."
Bolted joint design,Oil/gas/mixture leakage into crankcase leading to increased risk of crankcase explosion,"EXACT_MATCH based on high similarity: The retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same Subsystem ('Engine Block'), System Element ('Crankcase'), Function (Contact to V-room isolation supporting V-room structure), Failure Mode ('Oil/gas leakage between V-room and crankcase main bore room'), Failure Cause ('Bolted joint design'), and Failure Effect (oil/gas mixture leakage leading to increased risk of crankcase explosion) matches exactly with the target system. The preventive measures in retrieved data closely align with current measures ('FEA', 'VDI 2230', ultrasonic bolt measurement corresponds well with ultrasonic bolt measurement in target). Detective measures are similar (Bolted joint preload measurement vs Validation plan for V-room, MCE Functional Testing, Field validation which likely include bolted joint and V-room checks). Severity is consistent at 10 due to explosion risk and regulatory/financial impact. The occurrence rating is 4 (occasional), reflecting effective but not absolute preventive measures on bolted joint design with high fidelity calculations and measurements. Detection rating of 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) is appropriate given thorough functional testing and validation plans. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable to the target context with verification of measures and effect, resulting in Severity=10, Occurrence=4, Detection=3."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Oil/gas/mixture leakage into crankcase leading to increased risk of crankcase explosion,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6) is closely related to the retrieved data context (Gas Engine Type 4) as both are gas engine types within the same product category, subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact to V-room isolation), failure mode (Oil/gas leakage between V-room and crankcase main bore room), failure cause (Intake manifold and V-room design), and failure effect (Oil/gas/mixture leakage into crankcase leading to increased risk of crankcase explosion). The preventive and detective measures match exactly. Given the slight generational difference (Type 6 vs Type 4) but identical technical and functional context, the retrieved ratings are applicable but should be reviewed with slight consideration that newer engine models might have marginally improved occurrence through evolved design tolerances though the criticality remains. Severity is rated at the highest level 10 (risk of crankcase explosion is a catastrophic violation of safety regulations), which holds consistently. Preventive measures such as supplier recommendation, advanced simulations (FEA, CFD), and external consultation remain highly relevant but occurrence remains high at 9 due to the complexity and inherent design challenges of isolating V-room gases. Detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection such as endurance runs and field validation) is consistent given that the leakage risk is not always obvious until detailed performance and endurance testing. Therefore, the risk ratings are taken directly with rationale: Severity 10 (catastrophic risk), Occurrence 9 (frequent, due to complexity and limited elimination of cause despite advanced measures), Detection 5 (detection by targeted inspection and field validation)."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Engine damage due to loose bolt,"EXACT_MATCH with direct use of retrieved data: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved failure mode, cause, effect, subsystem, system element, and preventive/detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase component. The failure mode 'Oil/gas leakage between V-room and crankcase main bore room' caused by 'Intake manifold and V-room design' resulting in 'Engine damage due to loose bolt' was rated Severity 10, Occurrence 9, Detection 5 with the same preventive and detective measures listed. Therefore, the appropriate action is to reuse these ratings directly, ensuring consistency with rating definitions and existing controls."
Bolted joint design,Engine damage due to loose bolt,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Loose bolts in intake system' on the 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, caused by 'Bolted joint design', effect is 'Engine damage due to loose bolt'. Retrieved exact match data exists for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem, element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engine) and share the same functional context. Therefore, the retrieved ratings for 'Gas Engine Type 4' are highly relevant. Minor adaptation is needed based on the slight product evolution from Type 4 to Type 6, which likely maintains or slightly reduces occurrence due to potential improvements but since the preventive and detective measures are identical and comprehensive, occurrence rating can be conservatively retained or slightly lowered. Severity remains at maximum (10) due to serious engine damage. Detection rating is consistent with current strong detective measures. Final ratings set as: Severity 10 (consistent with engine damage regulatory/financial risk), Occurrence 4 (occasional occurrence reflecting effective FEA, design guidelines and measurement), Detection 3 (high likelihood of detection through pre-load and vibration measurements). These ratings ensure consistency and reliability with near exact retrieved scenario while acknowledging minor system evolution."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Engine damage due to loose bolt,"EXACT_MATCH with verification and validation due to exact match of product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function ('Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure'), failure mode ('Loose bolts in intake system'), failure cause ('Intake manifold and V-room design'), and failure effect ('Engine damage due to loose bolt'). The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 exactly matches the target context except for a newer engine type (Type 6) but same product category and very similar design and preventive/detective measures. Preventive measures and detective measures are nearly identical, indicating no significant difference in risk exposure or detection capability. Thus, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable. Severity is very high (10) due to engine damage risk, occurrence is very high (9) given the complex design influence despite preventive measures, and detection is moderate (5) since detection requires targeted endurance and performance tests. These ratings fit the scale definitions and reflect the risk posture with existing controls in place."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Decrease in engine efficiency due to inhomogeneous distribution of temperature of the gas,"EXACT_MATCH based on very close matching of all key elements: Product category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure), Failure Mode (Insufficient isolation of intake gas), Failure Cause (Intake manifold and V-room design), and Failure Effect (Decrease in engine efficiency due to inhomogeneous distribution of temperature of the gas). The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 shows fully matching preventive and detective measures, indicating that the effectiveness of controls is similar. Minor product generation difference (Type 6 vs Type 4) in the same product family and subsystem does not affect the relevance since the failure mechanism and consequences are the same. Preventive measures such as Supplier recommendation, FEA, CFD analysis, and 1d simulation are clearly documented and considered effective at reducing occurrence, but the occurrence is still high (9) indicating these measures mitigate but do not eliminate the risk due to complexity of intake manifold and V-room design. Detective measures include endurance runs, performance tests, thermal surveys, and field validation, reflecting a strong detection system with detection rating 4 (high likelihood of detection before customer delivery). Severity rating is consistent with a 7 indicating reduced engine performance, customer dissatisfaction, but no regulatory violation or severe financial loss. Thus, the existing retrieved ratings for Severity=7, Occurrence=9, and Detection=4 are used directly, fully complying with the rating definitions and decision matrix for exact match."
Water jacket design,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with a failure mode of 'Coolant leakage (pressure drop)' caused by 'Water jacket design' in the 'Crankcase' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The available data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' exactly matches the system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant), failure mode (Coolant leakage pressure drop), failure cause (Water jacket design), and failure effect (Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system). Preventive and detective measures are highly similar and include DP specifications, CFD analysis, 1d simulation, coolant system functional test, and endurance runs. Thus, although the engine type number differs, the product category (gas engine), system element, failure mode, and measures are effectively equivalent. Severity is consistent at 5, indicating moderate customer/process impact without severe regulatory or financial violation. Occurrence is rated at 4 (occasional occurrence), reflecting the moderate likelihood given robust preventive measures already in place. Detection rating is 3, indicating a high likelihood of detection prior to failure due to functional testing and endurance inspections. Considering slightly different engine generations but similar functional context, ratings are retained from retrieved data without adjustment."
Wall thickness,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"EXACT_MATCH based on the retrieved failure mode 'Coolant leakage (pressure drop)' in the 'Crankcase' component of 'Engine Block' subsystem within 'Gas Engine Type 4' which closely corresponds to the target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6', 'Crankcase', 'Coolant leakage (pressure drop)' caused by 'Wall thickness' and causing 'Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system'. Preventive and detective measures match exactly ('Component FPQ' and 'Crankcase leakage test' respectively). Severity is 5 consistent with document. Occurrence is 3 reflecting low likelihood due to effective FPQ preventive measure. Detection is 1 reflecting almost certain detection by crankcase leakage test. Ratings are directly extracted and consistent with given measures and failure effects."
O-Ring material selection,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant), failure mode (Coolant leakage over time - pressure drop), failure cause (O-Ring material selection), and closely matching preventive and detective measures. The preventive measures match exactly: 'Supplier recommendation, O-Ring calculation, O-Ring specification / Material selection', and detective measures: 'Leakage test, Endurance run (Leakage check)'. The failure effect severity is consistent as severity rating 5 is assigned for 'Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency (combustion system is impacted)', matching the target failure effect. Occurrence rating of 2 indicates low likelihood due to effective preventive measures, and Detection rating 2 indicates high likelihood of detection before delivery. The change from Gas Engine Type 4 to Type 6 is within the same product category and does not materially affect the failure mode, failure cause, or measures, therefore retrieved ratings can be used directly."
O-ring aging,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)' caused by 'O-ring aging' in the 'Crankcase' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved data contains highly similar failure modes for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, except for a different generation of the engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6). These engines share the same product category (gas engines) and operational environment. Preventive and detective measures are also highly aligned with the target system context. Therefore, we rely primarily on the directly retrieved ratings and adjust occurrence slightly to reflect any potential differences in preventive measure maturity in the newer engine type (Type 6 might have modest design improvements reducing occurrence slightly). Severity and detection ratings can be adopted directly, since failure effect severity is consistent and detective measures are similarly robust. Specifically: - Severity rating 5: Confirmed for this failure effect related to decrease in coolant pressure impacting the combustion system. - Occurrence rating 2 (retrieved) is consistent with current mature preventive measures and supplier involvement; given target measures are as strong or better, this remains appropriate or could even be slightly better, but we keep 2 to stay conservative. - Detection rating 5 (retrieved) matches with multiple endurance and field validation leakage inspections already in-place, implying detection is possible but only via targeted inspections rather than immediate or certain detection. Hence, detection rating remains at 5. Overall, the excellent contextual match and similarity in preventive and detective controls justify using these ratings with minor analytical reasoning. The target system is slightly newer (Type 6 vs Type 4) but since no further evidence suggests better or worse risk, ratings are directly applied from Type 4 context for calibration reliability."
Water circuit design,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)' in 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' context aligns closely with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same failure mode, failure cause ('Water circuit design'), subsystem, system element, and functional impact. The product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against coolant leakage), failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect are consistent. The existing preventive and detective measures match the retrieved ones almost exactly, ensuring applicability. The severity rating is stable at 5, corresponding to process disturbance and cooling efficiency impact as observed. Occurrence rating of 4 (occasional occurrence) reflects moderate likelihood given preventive measures like 1d analysis and CFD, which reduce but do not fully eliminate the risk. Detection rating of 5 (detection through targeted inspection such as endurance and functional testing) fits the described detective methods perfectly. Thus, adaptation from Gas Engine Type 4 to the slightly newer Gas Engine Type 6 context is justified without change, maintaining consistency and correctness."
Water jacket design,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"EXACT_MATCH by analogy with Gas Engine Type 4 context. The target failure mode 'Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)' in the 'Crankcase' of Gas Engine Type 6 matches exactly the failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4 system: same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function (Sealing against leakages coolant), same failure mode and cause ('Water jacket design'), and same failure effect ('Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system'). Preventive and detective measures listed are the same or highly similar, indicating comparable controls. The retrieved data provides Severity = 5, Occurrence = 4, Detection = 3, directly applicable here. Severity of 5 represents moderate process/customer impact without regulatory or major financial consequences, consistent with coolant pressure drop causing cooling inefficiency. Occurrence of 4 reflects occasional occurrence given the effective preventive measures including detailed design analyses and simulations. Detection at 3 corresponds to high likelihood of detection before causing customer impact via coolant system functional tests and endurance inspections, aligned with the target's detective measures. Therefore, the risk ratings are adopted directly following rating methodology for EXACT_MATCH."
Liner landing surface finish,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system,"EXACT_MATCH: There is a directly matching failure mode 'Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)' in the 'Crankcase' component of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 4', which is very close and fully applicable to 'Gas Engine Type 6' due to same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('Liner landing surface finish'), and failure effect ('Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion system'). Preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved context (DP 34 - Crankcase, Component measurement, DP 18 - Cylinder liner; Endurance run and Field validation (leakage check)) match the target system's existing measures exactly. Severity rating is consistent at 5, reflecting process disturbance and partial performance degradation but not regulatory violation or severe financial damage. Occurrence rating of 4 indicates occasional occurrence given preventive measures effectiveness but some residual risk. Detection rating of 5 reflects detection only through targeted inspection such as endurance runs and field leakage validations, matching detective methods provided. Therefore, the exact match ratings are appropriate without further adjustment."
O-Ring material selection,Surface corrosion on liner landing,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and highly consistent preventive and detective measures. The target is Gas Engine Type 6 but within the same product category (gas engines) and identical functional context and measures. The retrieved severity of 5 reflects moderate process impact (surface corrosion on liner landing) without regulatory violation or high financial damage, consistent with definitions. Occurrence is rated 2 due to robust preventive measures (Supplier recommendation, O-Ring calculation, and material specification), indicating an unlikely failure cause. Detection is 2 due to effective leakage and endurance testing that assure almost certain detection before customer delivery. No adjustment needed for new engine type as no indication of differing risk levels or measure effectiveness."
O-ring aging,Surface corrosion on liner landing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved context 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant), failure mode (Coolant leakage over time / pressure drop), failure cause (O-ring aging), and failure effect (Surface corrosion on liner landing). The preventive and detective measures are also very closely aligned, with minor additions in the target system such as 'Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', and 'Design life to be in acc. with maintenance schedule' which are extensions of the existing supplier and specification controls in the retrieved data. The detective measures include 'Leakage test' additionally, which improves detection capability compared to the retrieved data. \nSeverity is directly adopted as 5 from retrieved data since the failure effect (surface corrosion on liner landing) and its impact on cooling and liner integrity are the same.\nOccurrence in retrieved data is rated as 2 (Unlikely) due to effective preventive measures; given the target system adds more formal design and maintenance life alignment, occurrence rating is confirmed at 2, indicating preventive measures are strong and consistent.\nDetection rating in retrieved data for this failure cause/mode is 5 (detection only through targeted inspection - e.g., endurance run, field validation). The target system adds 'Leakage test' which typically improves detectability, potentially lowering detection rating to 4 (High likelihood of detection in subsequent processes). However, since detection is still based on endurance and leakage tests rather than continuous automatic detection or early process control, the detection rating is adjusted slightly better but still cautious at 5 to reflect that detection happens before customer delivery but may require targeted inspections.\nOverall, retrieved ratings closely match, and slight adjustment to detection rating reflects improved detection means in target system."
Water circuit design,Surface corrosion on liner landing,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved RAG and vector data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant), failure mode (Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)), failure cause (Water circuit design), and failure effect (Surface corrosion on liner landing). Product is closely related (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4) with same product category and functional context. Preventive and detective measures also match exactly. Severity is consistent across all similar failure effects at rating 5, indicating moderate process disturbance and impact on some customers. Occurrence at 4 reflects occasional occurrence given existing preventive measures (detailed thermal/fluid analysis and design reviews) that reduce but don't eliminate the risk. Detection at 5 means detection happens only via targeted inspection like endurance runs and functional testing, aligned with the measures described. Considering no significant context difference or measure variations, the risk ratings from the retrieved data are applicable directly without adjustment."
Water jacket design,Surface corrosion on liner landing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved FMEA data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' closely matches the target context 'Gas Engine Type 6' for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant), failure mode (Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)), failure cause (Water jacket design), and failure effect (Surface corrosion on liner landing). Preventive and detective measures are identical or very similar across both contexts, indicating that the risk scenarios and controls are highly analogous. Given the same product category (gas engines) and identical failure context, the severity rating remains consistent as the failure effect impact on engine operation and customer (severity 5: process disturbance, problems for some customers). The occurrence rating also remains consistent at 4 (occasional occurrence) as the preventive measures like detailed design practices (DP 34, DP 18, DP 28), CFD analysis, and simulations are established but do not fully eliminate the failure cause. The detection rating remains at 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes), justified by functional testing and endurance runs that effectively detect this failure before field issues arise. Slight differences in product version do not materially affect the ratings, so direct adaptation with no significant adjustment is appropriate."
Liner landing surface finish,Surface corrosion on liner landing,"EXACT_MATCH - The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 perfectly matches the target context in terms of Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Sealing against leakages coolant), Failure Mode (Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)), Failure Cause (Liner landing surface finish), and Failure Effect (Surface corrosion on liner landing). The preventive and detective measures are the same in both cases. Therefore, the risk ratings can be used directly. The retrieved Severity rating of 5 corresponds to moderate process disturbance and some customer impact due to surface corrosion on the liner landing, consistent with the target. Occurrence rating of 4 indicates occasional occurrence with existing preventive measures in place, reasonable given the controlled process measurements and design practices. Detection rating of 5 reflects detection only via targeted inspection methods such as endurance run leakage checks and field validations, corresponding well to the described detective measures. Hence, no upward or downward adjustment is required."
O-Ring aging,"Coolant in oil, coolant/oil leak to environment, loss of coolant/oil pressure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' caused by 'O-Ring aging' in the 'Crankcase' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data shows multiple exact matches for a very similar failure mode and cause in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system, same subsystem and system element (crankcase), with consistent preventive/detective measures and similar functional context ('Sealing against leakages coolant' or similar sealing functions). Despite slight differences in product type (Type 6 vs Type 4), the severity and risk factors are comparable because coolant/oil leakage and contamination effects have similar customer and environmental impacts across gas engine types. Preventive measures such as design specification adherence and supplier involvement are identical, and detective measures include extensive leakage and endurance testing, also matching. Severity ratings for failure effects are consistent and are: coolant in oil (5), coolant/oil leak to environment (7), loss of coolant/oil pressure (7), derived from similar failure effects in retrieved data with slight adaptation for combined multiple effects. Occurrence and detection ratings from closest references show O-Ring aging occurrence rating of 3 and detection rating of 4 with matched preventive/detective measures and testing regimes. Given the strong alignment of all factors and highly similar failure scenarios, ratings are adapted directly from retrieved Type 4 data without need for major adjustment, noting minor product differences do not materially change failure impact or control effectiveness."
Sealant / Gasket aging,"Coolant in oil, coolant/oil leak to environment, loss of coolant/oil pressure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) is very close to the retrieved data context (Gas Engine Type 4), same subsystem (Engine Block), and same system element (Crankcase). The failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time', the failure cause 'Sealant / Gasket aging', and the failure effects (coolant in oil, leak to environment, pressure loss) match closely. Preventive and detective measures align strongly with retrieved cases. Minor differences in engine type and slight potential variations in operating conditions may exist, but product category, function, and failure impact remain consistent. Considering these, we can adopt the retrieved ratings and confirm their relevance:

- Severity: Retrieved severity ratings for failure effects are 5 for 'Coolant in oil' and 7 for 'Coolant/oil leak to environment' and 'Loss of coolant/oil pressure'. For the combined failure effects listed, the highest severity rating applies (7).
- Occurrence: Retrieved occurrence is consistently 3 (low likelihood) for 'Sealant / Gasket aging' with the given preventive measures (design to specification, tolerances, supplier involvement, design life in line with maintenance schedule).
- Detection: Detection rating is consistently 4 (high likelihood of detection through leakage test and endurance inspection), which matches the existing detective measures.

Hence, the ratings are:
Severity = 7 (due to environmental leak and pressure loss causing customer dissatisfaction and reduced service)
Occurrence = 3 (low likelihood with adequate preventive measures)
Detection = 4 (high likelihood of detection prior to customer delivery through specified tests)"
Sealant / Gasket design,"Coolant in oil, coolant/oil leak to environment, loss of coolant/oil pressure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, sealing against coolant leakages) matches closely with multiple retrieved data entries from a very similar system (Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem and element, same failure mode and failure cause). The existing preventive and detective measures in the target system correspond well with those described for 'Sealant / Gasket design' failure cause in the retrieved data. Differences between Gas Engine Type 4 and 6 are minimal for this core function and failure mode, thus the retrieved ratings are highly applicable without large adjustments. Severity ratings for failure effects involving coolant in oil, coolant/oil leak to environment, and loss of coolant/oil pressure are consistently 5 or 7 in the retrieved data, reflecting moderate to high customer impact but not regulatory violation. Occurrence ratings for 'Sealant / Gasket design' cause with the given preventive measures are rated 3 (low likelihood to occasional) consistently. Detection ratings with the described testbench and inspection regime are rated 4 (high likelihood of detection by tests before customer delivery). Therefore, we adopt these ratings directly for the target context with no adjustment needed because of strong alignment in product category, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect and existing controls."
O-Ring design,Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Coolant leaks into crankcase over time' caused by 'O-Ring design' in the 'Crankcase' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data shows a closely related failure mode 'Coolant leaks into crankcase over time' in 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same failure cause and effect, and another very close failure mode 'Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The product category, subsystem, system element and function are equivalent or highly similar, though the product version differs (Type 4 vs Type 6). Preventive and detective measures overlap exactly. Severity for the failure effect 'Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown' is rated 5 in Type 4 data. Given similar impact, severity remains 5. Occurrence is rated at 3 in Type 4, reflecting moderate but controlled likelihood due to existing preventive measures (O-Ring catalogue and calculations). Given similar preventive measures and product type, occurrence rating of 3 is appropriate. Detection rating of 4 is consistent across retrieved contexts with the same detective measures (assembly trials, endurance and field testing daily inspections). Detection rating means high likelihood of detection before delivery but not certain. Therefore, detection rating remains 4. Overall, risk ratings from Type 4 are highly applicable and only minimal adjustment needed as per SIMILAR_CONTEXT rules."
Part is not machined to spec,Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Coolant leaks into crankcase over time' on the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches very closely with a documented failure mode on 'Cylinder liner assembly' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' concerning coolant leaking into the crankcase over time due to 'Part is not machined to spec'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (engine block), system element identity (crankcase/cylinder liner assembly closely related sealing components), function (sealing coolant), failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect (oil contamination leading to engine shutdown). The preventive and detective measures provided in the target context align closely with the retrieved context's measures. Some minor adaptation is needed due to slightly different engine types (Type 6 vs Type 4) and possibly different operational loads, but the functional and failure characteristics are very similar. Severity rating is consistent at 5 for oil contamination causing engine shutdown. Occurrence is rated 3 in retrieved data considering effective preventive measures like liner specification and drawing adherence; this fits the current measures. Detection is rated 4 since multiple layered functional and component inspections are done, consistent with detective measures listed. Therefore, directly adopting the retrieved ratings with confirmation of equivalency in measures is justified."
O-Ring aging,Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Coolant leaks into crankcase over time' caused by 'O-Ring aging', affecting Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown in the crankcase of the engine block. Retrieved data shows a very similar failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4 involving the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase/Cylinder liner assembly), function (sealing coolant), failure mode (Coolant leaks into crankcase over time), failure cause (O-Ring aging), and failure effect (Oil contamination leading to engine shutdown) with occurrences and detection defined. The preventive and detective measures are closely matching in description and scope. Adjustments consider the newer engine type 6 which likely has improved design and testing based on experience from Type 4 but similar sealing and maintenance principles. Severity is consistent at 5 due to the impact on engine shutdown (process disturbance with significant customer effect but no regulatory violation). Occurrence is set to 3 (low likelihood) as the preventive measures ('O-Ring specification catalogues', 'O-Ring calculation', 'Design according to specification', 'Tolerances', 'Supplier involvement', 'Maintenance schedule aligned design life') closely match the existing Type 4 preventive measures leading to a low but not negligible chance of O-Ring aging failures. Detection is rated 4 instead of 5 in Type 4 data to reflect robust multiple detective measures including MCE endurance testing, field validation, leakage tests, and detailed inspection steps all effective at daily inspections and assembly trials, providing a high likelihood of detecting the aging O-Ring before failure manifests in field, consistent with the extensive detective measures listed for Type 6. Hence ratings are adapted but based strongly on the closest retrieved exact failure cause ratings from Type 4 engine context."
Water jacket design,"Oxidation of coolant causing decrease of coolant efficiency, overheating of system components due to air bubbles","EXACT_MATCH with verification of rating consistency against retrieved data. The target failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches retrieved data for the same failure mode in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause 'Water jacket design', and failure effects. The preventive and detective measures also match ('DP 34 - Crankcase', 'DP 18 - cylinder liner', 'DP 28 - Hydraulic system', 'CFD Analysis (water jacket)', '1d simulation (coolant circuit)' and 'Coolant system functional test', 'Endurance run (inspection of parts)'). The retrieved severity rating for failure effects (coolant oxidation and overheating from air bubbles) is 5 for both effects. Occurrence is 4 considering the presence of established but not fully eliminating preventive measures. Detection rating is 2 reflecting high certainty of detection via coolant system functional testing and endurance runs. This alignment satisfies the rating definitions and consistency requirements."
Coolant type and maintenance,"Oxidation of coolant causing decrease of coolant efficiency, overheating of system components due to air bubbles","EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system' with failure cause 'Coolant type and maintenance' and failure effect 'Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency' and 'Overheating of system components due to air bubbles' is found exactly in the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function, failure mode, cause and effect with preventive and detective measures matching the target system. The product difference (Type 6 vs Type 4) is minimal within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem context, so ratings can be directly used from retrieved data. Severity is consistently rated 5 reflecting process disturbance and some customer issues but no regulatory violation or severe financial damage. Occurrence is rated 2 due to effective preventive measures: supplier recommendation, coolant guideline, and maintenance plan. Detection rating is 5 indicating detection primarily via targeted inspections (endurance run, field validation, coolant system function test). Thus, the retrieved ratings align with the target system and given measures, confirming EXCAT MATCH status and application of these ratings without adjustment."
Coolant system venting design/strategy,"Oxidation of coolant causing decrease of coolant efficiency, overheating of system components due to air bubbles","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from a very similar system context, being the same product category (Gas Engine) but an earlier generation (Gas Engine Type 4) instead of Type 6, with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant), failure mode (Air in the coolant circuit system), failure cause (Coolant system venting design/strategy), and failure effects (oxidation of coolant causing decreased coolant efficiency and overheating due to air bubbles). The preventive and detective measures are also consistent and similar to the target system context. Therefore, the existing ratings can be adapted with minor validation for the newer engine model. The severity rating of 5 is appropriate for this failure effect as it indicates process disturbance and problems for some customers, aligned with coolant efficiency decrease and overheating issues but not regulatory violations or engine shutdowns. Occurrence rating is 5 based on existing preventive measures (TA venting practices, 3D Model filling simulation) and observed occasional occurrences. Detection is rated 5 reflecting detection mostly through endurance runs and field validations which are targeted inspections and not 100% certain before delivery. Given the same severity and failure effect, and similar preventive/detective effectiveness, these adapted ratings fit the target system context well."
Engine cooling filling process,"Oxidation of coolant causing decrease of coolant efficiency, overheating of system components due to air bubbles","EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with nearly identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages coolant / Ensuring no air in coolant circuit), failure mode ('Air in the coolant circuit system'), failure cause ('Engine cooling filling process'), and failure effects ('Oxidation of coolant leading to decrease coolant efficiency' and 'Overheating of system components due to air bubbles'). Differences in Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4 considered minor for this context due to consistent functional and design principles of engine cooling and sealing. Preventive and detective measures are also matching or equivalent. Thus, severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the retrieved data apply directly without adjustment."
"Crankcase design deficiencies such as inadequate material thickness, incorrect geometry, or insufficient rigidity",Damage on interface components resulting from excessive deformation or stress concentration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context involves the 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Crankcase design deficiencies.' Retrieved data contains several closely matching failure modes of 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' crankcase and related engine block components (e.g., Rear end cover, Front end housing). The failure effects 'Damage on interface components' and related effects have consistent severity ratings of 8 in the retrieved context, matching the target failure effect severity classification (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction, significant damage). Preventive measures overlap strongly (Design acc. to specification, Tolerances, MBS, FEA), and detective measures (Leakage test, Endurance run, Assembly test, MCE testbench testing) are also very similar in scope and capability. Occurrence rating of 3 and detection rating of 4 for crankcase design-related insufficient structural support in Gas Engine Type 4 align with the target's preventive/detective measures effectiveness profile. Minor context difference: Gas Engine Type 6 may imply potential scale or design improvements, but no indication that measures are more or less effective than in Type 4. Therefore, the occurrence and detection ratings are adapted directly without changes. Severity rating is consistent with retrieved rating for similar failure effect. Hence, ratings are: Severity 8, Occurrence 3, Detection 4."
"Bolted joint design errors, including incorrect bolt preload, wrong bolt grade, or inappropriate joint configuration",Loosening of bolts leading to loss of structural integrity and assembly failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' due to 'Bolted joint design errors' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares strong similarity with existing failure modes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, specifically failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' occurring in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', caused by 'Bolted joint design'. These retrieved failure modes have well-evaluated severity, occurrence, and detection ratings that align with the target cause and effect in a very similar system context (same subsystem, same functional element identity (crankcase related support), same failure mode and cause). Therefore, the retrieved ratings are adapted for the target system, considering the similar operating and design environment but slight advances in Type 6 design and possible matured preventive and detective measures. Preventive measures like FEA, VDI2230 calculation, and bolt preload measurement for bolted joints in the target system are consistent with those in the retrieved data, so occurrence ratings are retained mostly. The detective measures including preload measurements and multiple testbench assessments are robust but not perfect; thus detection rating is similar. Severity is directly comparable, as loosening bolts leading to loss of structural integrity represents a severe consequence causing damage and stiffness loss, rated as 8 in retrieved data. Minor adjustments reflect slight evolution in design maturity from Type 4 to Type 6, but overall ratings remain consistent with retrieved data due to strong context similarity and comparable measures."
"Assembly process errors such as improper torqueing, misalignment during assembly, or incomplete fastening",Lack of stiffness causing excessive movement or vibration in the engine block,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase in Engine Block subsystem with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by assembly process errors. Retrieved data include very similar failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' in Gas Engine Type 4 cranks, Engine Block subsystem, with nearly identical failure causes including 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and very similar preventive/detective measures. Severity is consistent due to the core failure effect 'Lack of stiffness causing excessive movement or vibration' rated 8, matching retrieved failure effects for similar failure modes. Preventive measures including RAIP, FPQ, assembly instructions, design team involvement are also consistent, so occurrence rating is adapted from retrieved occurrence 5 for assembly process causes but slightly moderated to 4 due to enhanced sensor and process specifications in Type 6 context possibly reducing occurrence somewhat. Detection ratings are mostly 4 in retrieved cases due to comprehensive functional, endurance, commissioning and testbench tests detecting assembly errors before delivery; this matches the target's detective measures. Hence detection is rated 4. This adaptation accounts for slightly improved process maturity in newer Gas Engine Type 6 but same core risks and detection abilities."
Geometry tolerances not met or incorrect tolerance specifications leading to misfit conditions or stress risers,Damage on interface components and reduction in stiffness affecting engine durability,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' matches the function and failure mode exactly within the same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem (Engine Block), and very similar system element (Front end housing or Rear end cover vs Crankcase) with consistent failure causes and effects. The difference is the specific system element (Crankcase vs Front/Rear end housings) and a slightly different gas engine type (Type 6 target vs Type 4 retrieved), which likely has somewhat similar design and operating conditions. Existing preventive and detective measures are highly aligned between the contexts (e.g., design according to specs, tolerance control, simulation, comprehensive bench and assembly testing). Failure effects severity (damage on interface components and stiffness loss affecting durability) matches severity rating 8 in retrieved context indicating a significant customer/system impact (dissatisfaction, reduced durability). Occurrence ratings for failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' are consistently 3 (low likelihood) considering extensive preventive design and tolerance management. Detection ratings are consistently 4, representing a high likelihood of detection using robust MCE testbench, assembly tests, vibration measurement, endurance runs, FPQ parts, and monitoring. Considering the target system has similar or possibly slightly more rigorous preventive and detective processes, the ratings from the retrieved data are directly applicable with minimal adjustment. Severity remains at 8 due to serious impact on structural integrity and durability. Occurrence remains 3 due to effective preventive measures in place. Detection remains 4 reflecting strong detection capabilities before customer impact."
Bolted joint design suboptimal for expected vibrational and thermal loads resulting in fatigue or cracking,Oil leakage through failure in the connection to the Crankcase Ventilation (CCV) system due to structural cracks or deformation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode and failure cause are closely related to previously retrieved failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' in a very similar component (Crankcase and associated CCV system), within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem (Engine Block). The failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and preventive/detective measures match closely with those found for the failure cause 'Bolted joint design' leading to leakage in related crankcase sealing issues. However, the target failure mode explicitly combines vibration and thermal fatigue leading to structural failure causing oil leakage through connection to the CCV system, which implies a higher and more specific mechanical stress context compared to general leakage over time. The severity must be consistent with a leakage through crack/deformation causing oil leakage outside the crankcase via the CCV connection. Severity from similar leakage to environment cases is rated at a high level (severity 10) due to environmental contamination and possible regulation violation. Occurrence rating for 'Bolted joint design' preventive measures (VDI 2230 hand calculation, FEA simulation, ultrasonic bolt measurement) aligns with previous data at rating 5 indicating occasional failures despite measures. Detection rating aligns with detection methods involving validation plans, functional testing, and field validation at rating 5 since dedicated testing can find defects before customer impact but not with certainty in routine production. Given the thermal and vibration induced failure mode in bolted joints, occurrence is not reduced but severity is at maximum due to environmental leakage and compliance impact. Detection remains moderate due to inspection complexity. Therefore, Severity = 10, Occurrence = 5, Detection = 5 is recommended, adapted from the highly similar failure modes and failure causes context but reflecting the slightly higher impact of structural cracking due to combined vibration and thermal loads causing leakage to environment."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 while target is Gas Engine Type 6, but all other aspects (Subsystem, System Element: Crankcase, Function: gas mixture delivery, Failure Mode: inconsistent gas density across cylinders, Failure Cause: intake manifold and V-room design, Failure Effect: decrease of combustion efficiency / power loss) align exactly. The failure cause and preventive/detective measures are identical, indicating a very similar technical context but a newer engine type that might feature incremental improvements. Severity ratings for the same failure effect are consistent across retrieved cases (mostly 4-6 for performance decrease). Occurrence is rated very high (9) in Gas Engine Type 4, indicating frequent occurrence despite measures. Detection is rated 4, indicating high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes but not certain. No significant improvements in preventive or detective measures observed for Type 6 vs Type 4 to justify reduction in occurrence or detection rating. Thus, retain severity=4 (process disturbance, problems for some customers), occurrence=9 (very frequent), detection=4 (high likelihood of detection through performance tests and thermal surveys)."
Cylinder head interface design,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"EXACT_MATCH with direct usage of retrieved data due to full match on Product Category (Gas engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (Crankcase), Function (Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head), Failure Mode (Inconsistent gas density across cylinders), Failure Cause (Cylinder head interface design), and Failure Effect (Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss). Preventive measures ('O-Ring calculation', '3D Model analysis', 'O-Ring specification') and detective measures ('Performance test', 'Thermal survey (intake port temperature)') perfectly match the retrieved case from Gas Engine Type 4. Thus, ratings directly apply with no adjustment needed. Severity is consistent at 4 indicating process disturbance and some customer problem (power loss). Occurrence rating of 2 reflects effective preventive measures reducing failure cause likelihood to unlikely. Detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection via performance and thermal tests before customer impact."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system ('Gas Engine Type 6', Crankcase component, Engine Block subsystem) and the retrieved context ('Gas Engine Type 4', Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase-related components) share the same product category (gas engines) and the same system element identity (Crankcase or closely related airflow pathways). The failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and failure cause 'Crankcase design' match functionally, with nearly identical preventive and detective measures. The failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' is consistent across contexts with severity rated as 5 in the retrieved data. Considering the slightly newer product (Type 6 vs. Type 4) but similar design preventive and detective measures, the original ratings for occurrence (5 - occasional occurrence) and detection (4 - high likelihood of detection) remain appropriate without adjustment. Severity is confirmed at 5, reflecting moderate engine performance impact but no regulatory violation or catastrophic failure."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure scenario is 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6', caused by 'V-room design', with effect 'Drop in engine performance'. The retrieved data provides an EXACT match for a very similar failure mode and cause in 'Gas Engine Type 4', specifically in 'V-room insulation' (a closely related system element within the same 'Engine Block' subsystem and same function of providing gas mixture to cylinder head). Both target and retrieved failure modes concern flow disturbance due to V-room design, causing performance drop, so severity rating (5) is consistent and applicable directly. Preventive measures in target and retrieved contexts are highly similar and extensive (simulations, RAIP, FPQ, drawing specs, FEA, O-ring spec), so occurrence rating can be adapted from 5 (occasional occurrence) in the retrieved Type 4 context to also 5 for Type 6, assuming similar design maturity and preventive effectiveness. Detective measures are very comprehensive and functional testing plus field validation are present in both, but the retrieved detection rating is 2 (certain detection in subsequent processes), which is appropriate. Detection rating of 2 is valid for the target context given similar detective measures. Thus, applying the same severity, occurrence, detection ratings is justified with minor contextual consideration. Overall, this is a SIMILAR_CONTEXT match with analytical reasoning confirming the applicability of the retrieved ratings to the target system context."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the Engine Block subsystem's Crankcase, caused by 'Design for maintenance' and resulting in 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' on a closely matching failure mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder') with the same failure cause ('Design for maintenance') and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance') in the Engine Block subsystem but a different system element ('V-room insulation') provides direct risk ratings: Severity=5, Occurrence=5, Detection=5. Preventive and detective measures in both contexts are highly similar and of comparable maturity and scope (design guidelines, simulations, quality control, and multiple functional and field validations). Minor contextual differences (Crankcase vs V-room insulation) do not strongly affect severity or detectability; occurrence is consistent given the same preventive measures. Hence, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable with no adjustment needed."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)', failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' aligns closely with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for related failure modes such as 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', with the same failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'. While they differ in exact product generation (Type 6 vs Type 4) and system element naming (Crankcase vs V-room insulation or Crankcase itself), the functional context and failure cause are highly similar within the same product category and subsystem. The retrieved ratings are occurrence=2, detection=4-5, severity=5 for failure modes with 'casting tolerances' causing flow disturbance leading to drop in engine performance. Preventive and detective measures for the target are very similar or expanded with additional simulation and functional testing steps, suggesting occurrence and detection should remain similarly low or very slightly improved. Severity rating of 5 (process disturbance/problems for some customers) matches impact of drop in engine performance without regulatory or financial damages beyond customer dissatisfaction threshold. Thus, severity=5, occurrence=2 (unlikely with good preventive controls - RAIP, FPQ, drawing specs), detection=5 (detection by targeted inspections and functional testing but not always certain pre-delivery). The detection is aligned with slightly more scrutiny but not certain detection, consistent with the provided detective measures including assembly trials and performance measurement. Overall, due to the very strong similarity in context and measures, the retrieved ratings are adapted with minor justification - detection rating kept at 5 due to slight difference in detection thoroughness compared to 4 in data. This follows the SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating methodology."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure scenario (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, function to provide gas mixture route to cylinder head, failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)', failure effect 'Drop in engine performance') closely matches retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 located in the same subsystem (Engine Block) though for 'V-room insulation' component with the failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' caused by 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' and resulting in 'Drop in engine performance'. Both share the same function context (gas mixture supply), failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect type. Preventive and detective measures are very similar, supporting a transfer of ratings as a baseline. However, since the system element differs (Crankcase vs V-room insulation), and Type 6 could have subtle differences in control or sensitivity, a slight adaptation is warranted. The severity rating is consistent across all related failure modes causing 'Drop in engine performance' in this system category at 5, indicating moderate customer impact (process disturbance/problems for some customers). Occurrence is rated 5 in the reference data, reflecting occasional occurrence despite preventive measures; this fits well given that transient operation is inherently variable and not fully controllable. Detection rating 4 shows high likelihood of detection via functional/performance testing and validation plans before customer impact, which also aligns with provided detective measures. In the Crankcase context, the function is more direct in gas routing, potentially not easier to detect failures, but the existing detection portfolio suggests good coverage, so detection rating remains at 4. Thus, final ratings adopt the retrieved Type 4 data values with reasoning supporting minimal downward or upward adjustment."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' (Gas Engine Type 6) shares the same system element identity (gas mixture route component), function, failure mode, failure cause (Combustion system), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance') with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'V-room insulation'. Preventive and detective measures are closely matching and similarly robust. Differences in product version (Type 6 vs Type 4) and specifically the system element (Crankcase vs V-room insulation) are within the same subsystem and serve very similar functional paths, so ratings can be adapted with slight confidence. Given that severity and failure effect are the same and preventive/detective measures are effectively equivalent, severity remains 5. Occurrence is consistent at 5 due to similar measures and system maturity. Detection is rated 4 in the retrieved context, corresponding to high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes (validation plans, functional testing), which are also present in the target context. Hence, the adapted ratings remain the same. This adaptation is justified as the failure mode impact and controls do not drastically differ in this closely related system environment and product category."
V-room design,"['Drop in engine performance', 'Instability in combustion process']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and retrieved data (Gas Engine Type 4) differ in product version but maintain the same engine block subsystem, crankcase element, function (provide gas mixture route to cylinder head), failure mode (insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder), failure cause (V-room design), and failure effects (drop in engine performance, instability in combustion). The operating principle and preventive/detective measures are highly similar, suggesting strong contextual relevance. Severity ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable as impact on engine performance and combustion instability is comparable. Occurrence rating from existing data is 5, indicating occasional occurrence given current preventive measures. Detection rating in retrieved data ranges from 2 to 4 depending on failure mode context; the closest analogous failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' without transient operation) uses detection rating 2 due to extensive MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation. Given the target context does not specify transient conditions, detection rating 2 is appropriate. Thus, severity is aligned with documented rating 5; occurrence is maintained at 5 reflecting preventive measures effectiveness; detection is adapted at 2 reflecting high likelihood of detection before customer impact through functional and field testing."
Material selection,"['Drop in engine performance', 'Instability in combustion process']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same failure mode, failure cause ('Material selection'), failure effect ('Drop in engine performance' and 'Instability in combustion process'), and subsystem ('Engine Block') as documented failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' systems, specifically for the 'V-room insulation' component. Both address air/gas mixture supply issues impacting combustion and engine performance and instability, a similar functional context (providing gas mixture route to cylinder head). The preventive and detective measures in the target system are closely aligned with those referenced in the retrieved data, indicating similar effectiveness and coverage. Severity ratings for these failure effects are consistently rated as 5 in the retrieved data, reflecting process disturbance and problems for some customers. Occurrence ratings for 'Material selection' failure cause are consistently rated as 5, indicating occasional occurrence despite existing preventive measures such as 1d simulation and FEA. Detection ratings for this combination are 4 in the reference data, representing detection through high likelihood in subsequent testing and field validation processes (e.g., MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation). Given the strong similarity in failure mode, cause, effect, preventive, and detective measures, these retrieved ratings are appropriate with no adjustment needed for the target system with slightly newer engine type but same product category and subsystem context."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"['Drop in engine performance', 'Instability in combustion process']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)', affecting the 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' function in the Engine Block subsystem. Relevant retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4—same product category, same subsystem and system element, nearly identical failure mode, failure cause, and similar failure effects—provides direct FMEA ratings for this failure cause paired with slightly different but related failure modes. Preventive and detective measures match closely. Minor differences in engine type and exact failure wording mean exact reuse of ratings is not ideal but direct adaptation is strongly justified. The severity rating of failure effects 'Drop in engine performance' and 'Instability in combustion process' is consistently rated 5 in Gas Engine Type 4 for similar failure modes with the same cause. Occurrence rating is 2 due to strong preventive controls (RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specs, design guidelines). Detection is rated 5 or 4 depending on failure mode context but similar detective measures (validation plans, assembly trials, performance measurements, field validations) support a detection rating of 5 for this exact failure mode and cause pairing because detection requires targeted inspection. Hence, adapting retrieved ratings with a Severity of 5, Occurrence 2, and Detection 5 matches the target context well, capturing impact, preventive and detective effectiveness appropriately."
Combustion system,"['Drop in engine performance', 'Instability in combustion process']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' in Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' closely matches the documented failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' occurring in similar subsystem and system element context with identical failure cause 'Combustion system' and failure effects ('Drop in engine performance', 'Instability in combustion process'). Although the product version differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the subsystem, system element, functional role, and failure mode/failure cause are effectively the same. Preventive and detective measures are consistent and comparable. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable but can be slightly adapted considering possible incremental improvements in newer engine versions, yet current preventive/detective measures show similar coverage. Severity rating is consistent at 5 for the combined failure effects. Occurrence rating is 5 as per existing preventive measures effectiveness. Detection rating is 4 matching current detective measures. No major contextual reason to scale ratings up or down significantly."
Cylinder head interface design,"['Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss', 'Gas in environment']","EXACT_MATCH - The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase component, providing gas mixture route to cylinder head) and failure mode (Gas mixture leakage) caused by 'Cylinder head interface design' matches exactly to a documented case from Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category and functional context). Preventive measures ('O-Ring calculation', 'O-Ring specification', '3D Model analysis') and detective measures ('Endurance run (leakage check)') are closely aligned with retrieved data. The retrieved severity ratings show a dual effect: 'Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss' rated 4 (moderate process/customer impact) and 'Gas in environment' rated 10 (very severe due to environmental hazard). Occurrence is rated 2 (unlikely) given effective preventive measures. Detection is rated 2 (high detection certainty) using endurance run and performance tests. Considering the close match in product subsystem and identical failure mode, with preventive/detective measures aligned, the original retrieved ratings are used without adjustment."
Intake manifold and V-room design,"['Engine misfiring', 'Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output']","EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase, failure mode 'Too low gas intake to cylinder head', failure cause 'Intake manifold and V-room design' which matches the target context closely because same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function, failure mode, cause, and failure effects observed. Preventive measures in target match or exceed those in retrieved data, and detective measures are absent in target but exist in retrieved data, so detection rating in retrieved data reflects moderate detectability. Ratings from retrieved data are consistent with the preventive and detective measures provided. Thus, applying these ratings directly is justified."
Deposit in intake system,"['Engine misfiring', 'Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output']","EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Too low gas intake to cylinder head' on system 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', component 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' with cause 'Deposit in intake system' and effects 'Engine misfiring' and 'Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output' exactly matches the retrieved failure mode (id 61) from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect, and very similar preventive ('Selection of gas quality requirements' vs 'Selection of gas quality requirements') and detective measures ('Endurance run (performance degradation)', 'Field validation (performance degradation)'). The product and context are closely related gas engines, making it a close exact match. Therefore, risk ratings are adopted directly as per retrieved data, ensuring consistency. The severity rating is 6, occurrence rating is 2 reflecting effective preventive measure on gas quality reducing deposits, and detection rating is 2 reflecting reliable endurance run and field validation measures. No adjustment needed due to strong similarity of context, measures and effects."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Decrease in engine efficiency due to inhomogeneous distribution of temperature of the gas,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved failure mode 'Insufficient isolation of intake gas' with cause 'Intake manifold and V-room design' and effect 'Decrease in engine efficiency due to inhomogeneous distribution of temperature of the gas' is from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same failure mode, cause, and effect as the target Gas Engine Type 6 system. Preventive and detective measures are also identical or very similar. Therefore, this is a close match but different product version within the same product category (Gas Engines). Given similarity in engineering and measures, the existing ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable with minimal adjustment. Severity remains 7, as engine efficiency decrease causes reduced service/dissatisfaction. Occurrence is high (9) despite preventive measures, indicating a frequent issue with the cause/design complexity. Detection rating of 4 reflects relatively high likelihood of detection via performance and thermal tests before shipment or field failures. No major operating environment or subsystem changes justify adjustment; thus we keep ratings consistent with retrieved data."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows multiple failure modes of 'Oil leakage' with failure cause 'Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)' impacting the 'Crankcase' sealing function in Gas Engine Type 4, which closely matches the target Gas Engine Type 6 context. Preventive and detective measures listed are nearly identical and equally robust. However, due to potential slight differences in engine design and operating conditions between Type 4 and Type 6, a mild adjustment to detection rating reflects slightly less certainty in detecting leaks before delivery. The failure effect 'Oil in environment' severity is consistently rated as 4 in Type 4 data, indicating process disturbance with problems for some customers. Severity does not change as failure effect and impact context remain the same. Occurrence remains low (2) due to comprehensive preventive measures. Detection is adjusted from 5 (retrieved) to 4 recognizing the strong detection capability of endurance tests and functional tests, slightly better than the Type 4 context's indication but still reflecting minor possibility of missing early detection. Hence, the adapted ratings are Severity=4, Occurrence=2, Detection=4."
Position of blow-by extraction,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) shares the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against oil leakage), failure mode (Oil leakage), failure cause (Position of blow-by extraction), and failure effect (Oil in environment) as the retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4. Preventive and detective measures listed for both contexts are effectively the same and comparable in scope and detail. Thus, the retrieved risk ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable with minimal adjustments. The slight difference in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) represents a similar context where design improvements or operational conditions may be marginal, but conservative practice suggests keeping occurrence and detection ratings aligned due to identical measures. Severity remains the same as it reflects effect on environment customer/service level, which is consistent across both engine types."
Bolted joint design,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase bolted joint design causing oil leakage to the environment. Retrieved FMEA data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against oil leakage), failure mode (Oil leakage), failure cause (Bolted joint design), and failure effect (Oil in environment). Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical. Severity rating consistently rated as 4, reflecting a moderate effect causing process disturbance/customers inconvenience but not severe regulatory or financial impact. Occurrence ratings for the same failure cause and preventive measures are consistently 4 (occasional occurrence), with similar detection ratings (3) given the presence of bolted joint pre-load and vibration measurements that provide high likelihood detection during subsequent processes. Given the strong match and similar product category and functional context, ratings from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are directly applicable and appropriate without adjustment."
Liquid sealing degradation,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, sealing function) and failure mode (Oil leakage) with failure cause (Liquid sealing degradation) and failure effect (Oil in environment) matches strongly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 (a close gas engine variant in the same product category and functional context). The preventive and detective measures given are exactly the same ('Liquid sealant specification' and 'Endurance run', 'Field validation') and map directly to failure modes 'Oil leakage' and 'Oil leakage over time' caused by the same failure cause leading to 'Oil in environment'. Severity rating in Gas Engine Type 4 data is 4 (process disturbance, some customer problems) for such oil leakage causing environmental presence, aligned with the definition and failure effects. Occurrence is low (2) reflecting effective preventive measures (liquid sealant specification) strongly limiting failure cause. Detection is rated 5 in retrieved data corresponding to detection mainly through targeted inspection (endurance runs and field validation), coherent with the detective measures listed without inline or automatic detection. Considering the similarity in engine type (same category, similar subsystems), function, failure mode, cause, effect, and identical measures, the retrieved ratings can be applied with minimal adjustment. The target system context likely has similar customer and environmental impact and maintenance/testing practices. Therefore, Severity=4, Occurrence=2, Detection=5 is an accurate mapping for the target context."
Position of blow-by system,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode 'Oil leakage' with failure cause 'Position of blow-by system' and failure effect 'Oil in environment' in 'Crankcase' of 'Engine Block' exists in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same preventive and detective measures, and the product 'Gas Engine Type 6' is very close in product category and functional context. The preventive measures and detective measures are almost identical, and the failure effect severity should be consistent. The retrieved severity is 4 as it causes environmental oil leakage (process disturbance, problems for some customers), occurrence is rated at 4 considering occasional occurrence with good preventive measures, and detection is rated at 2 due to very good detection measures including endurance runs, field validation, assembly and functional tests. However, slight adjustment to occurrence from 4 to 4 (unchanged) to reflect possible variation in newer engine type, detection remains at 2 reflecting strong detection methods. Severity rating consistent at 4 due to similar customer and environmental impact. Therefore, adapt the existing ratings directly with minimal adjustment."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' compared to the retrieved most relevant exact product context 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both share the same product category (gas engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode ('Oil leakage'), failure cause ('Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)'), and failure effect ('Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure'). The preventive and detective measures are also nearly identical to the retrieved case, confirming high similarity in functional and design context. Since the retrieved ratings originate from a very similar engine type and identical failure scenario with matching measures, these ratings can be adapted with minor consideration for possible differences in operating conditions or design improvements from Type 4 to Type 6, which are generally incremental and do not drastically change failure mode behavior or detection/prevention capabilities. Therefore, the retrieved Severity=7, Occurrence=2, Detection=3 ratings are valid and applicable with no need for significant adjustment."
Position of blow-by extraction,Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase element, Sealing against oil leakage function, with matching failure mode 'Oil leakage', failure cause 'Position of blow-by extraction', and failure effect 'Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure'. Preventive and detective measures in the target system context perfectly match the retrieved data preventive and detective measures. Therefore, use the provided risk ratings directly: Severity 7, Occurrence 6, Detection 5."
Bolted joint design,Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, Sealing against oil leakage, failure mode 'Oil leakage' due to 'Bolted joint design', with failure effect 'Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure') matches almost exactly the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are also matching between the target and retrieved data. The retrieved data provides Severity=7, Occurrence=4, Detection=3 for this failure mode/failure cause combination. These ratings are consistent with the rating schema: a serious customer impact causing reduced service (S=7), occasional occurrence due to mature preventive measures (O=4), and good detection likelihood via bolted joint pre-load and vibration measurements (D=3). Given the same product category and similar engine block function, the ratings directly apply. Therefore, no adaptation is necessary."
Liquid sealing degradation,Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match on all key failure attributes except that it is for Gas Engine Type 4 while the target is Gas Engine Type 6, both within the same product category (Gas Engine) and identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage), failure cause (Liquid sealing degradation), and failure effect (Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure). Preventive and detective measures are the same ('Liquid sealant specification' and 'Endurance run', 'Field validation'), indicating similar risk control effectiveness. The severity rating aligns with the significant customer impact: decreased oil pressure causing lubrication loss, rated as 7 consistent with dissatisfaction and reduced service. Occurrence is low (2) reflecting effective preventive measures. Detection is rated 5 meaning detection is possible only through targeted inspection (Endurance run, Field validation). Between engine types 4 and 6, no fundamental functional or environmental changes affecting failure risk or detection are indicated, so direct use of retrieved ratings is justified with minimal adjustments. Hence, the final risk ratings are Severity=7, Occurrence=2, Detection=5."
Position of blow-by system,Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and failure involves 'Oil leakage' from the 'Crankcase' due to 'Position of blow-by system' causing 'Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure'. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' (same product category 'Gas Engine'), identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect with very similar preventive and detective measures provides a highly relevant baseline. The preventive measures in the target include all key elements from the retrieved data plus additional tests (Hammer/Modal test, Genset vibration test) which likely improve failure cause prevention and detection. The detective measures also include all from retrieved data with enhancements like longer field validation (2000h) and additional testing methods. Therefore, occurrence should be adjusted slightly lower reflecting improved preventive measures. Severity remains unchanged as the failure effect and customer/system impact remain identical. Detection rating reflects even higher likelihood of detection due to more comprehensive testing. Summary: Severity = 7 (same effect, consistent), Occurrence = 3 (slightly better preventive measures than original 4), Detection = 2 (improved detection measures than original 2, at best near-certain detection but consistent with baseline)."
Position of blow-by extraction,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage over time), failure cause (Position of blow-by extraction), and failure effect (Oil in environment) matches the target context closely, differing only in the product generation (Type 6 vs. Type 4). The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data are identical or very similar to those in the target system. Given that both are gas engines, the operational and environmental conditions are expected to be very similar, thus severity and detection ratings can be directly applied. The occurrence rating is also consistent with the preventive measures provided and does not need adjustment. Therefore, the risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are suitable for adaptation with no significant change required."
Bolted joint design,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target product is 'Gas Engine Type 6' while retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', with the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function (Sealing against leakages oil), same failure mode (Oil leakage over time), same failure cause (Bolted joint design) and same failure effect (Oil in environment). This is the same product category (gas engines) and functional context with only a product version difference. Therefore, retrieved ratings are highly applicable but will be slightly adapted considering newer product might have improved preventive or detective measures presence but also potential regulatory tightening or environmental concerns increasing severity perception."
O-ring aging,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase sealing against oil leakage due to O-ring aging, which closely parallels multiple detailed failure cases from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode ('Oil leakage over time'), failure cause ('O-ring aging'), and failure effect ('Oil in environment'). The preventive measures are very similar and detective measures identical or comparable (endurance run, leakage inspection, field validation). Given the same product category (gas engines), similar operating conditions, and similar design and maintenance approaches, the retrieved ratings for 'Gas Engine Type 4' serve as a strong baseline. Slight contextual updates consider that potential incremental improvements in Type 6 preventive design and maintenance could marginally reduce occurrence, but severity and detection remain consistent due to similar failure consequences and inspection methods. Therefore, Severity stays at 4 (process disturbance, some customer problems, as oil leakage over environment is not regulatory critical but is a disturbance), Occurrence adjusted slightly upward from 2 to 3 due to aging O-ring natural degradation over longer use, and Detection remains at 5 due to detection primarily through targeted endurance and leakage inspections prior to customer impact."
Liquid sealing degradation,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, Sealing against oil leakage, failure mode 'Oil leakage over time', cause 'Liquid sealing degradation', effect 'Oil in environment') matches exactly the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect with identical preventive ('Liquid sealant specification') and detective ('Endurance run', 'Field validation') measures. Given the high similarity of engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product category and consistent preventive/detective measures, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the retrieved data are directly applicable without adjustment. Severity rating of 4 aligns with a moderate environmental leakage effect (process/customer disturbance), occurrence rating of 2 reflects low likelihood due to specified sealant preventive measure, and detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection through targeted endurance and field inspections as per measures."
Position of blow-by system,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, same system element (Crankcase), same function (Sealing against leakages oil), same failure mode ('Oil leakage over time'), and same failure cause ('Position of blow-by system') and failure effect ('Oil in environment') as the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4. The existing preventive and detective measures for the target system are very similar to or a superset of the retrieved data measures from Gas Engine Type 4. The failure effect severity is consistent with the retrieved severity rating. Given the close similarity in subsystem function, system element identity, failure mode, cause, effect, and preventive/detective measures, the retrieved ratings can be adapted to the target system with slight reasoning: - Severity remains the same at 4, as the failure effect 'Oil in environment' causes similar process disturbances and problems for some customers in both engine types. There is no increased regulatory or financial risk that would justify a higher severity. - Occurrence: The retrieval shows occurrence rating 6 for 'Position of blow-by extraction' in some related failure modes, but the retrieved direct match for 'Position of blow-by system' is rated occurrence 4 in one instance and 6 in another closely related mode. The target's preventive measures are comprehensive and include advanced analysis (CFD, modal, multi-body). Given Gas Engine Type 6 may be a newer or improved version, the occurrence is assessed slightly lower or equal to the retrieved data (which is 4 or 6), conservatively set at 4 (occasional occurrence) acknowledging preventive measures' effectiveness. - Detection is rated 2 in the retrieved context (certain detection through endurance run, assembly test, MCE test, field validation, and vibration testing), and the target measures include additional tests like hammer/modal and genset vibration test, which likely maintain or improve detection capabilities. Detection is thus assigned 2 (certain detection). This rating aligns with the note that detection rating must match specific failure mode-cause-detective measure pairs. Overall, the context is very similar, with consistent product category and similar preventive/detective measures, allowing use of retrieved data with minor adjustment for occurrence due to assumed system improvement. This results in Severity:4, Occurrence:4, Detection:2 for the Gas Engine Type 6 'Oil leakage over time' failure due to 'Position of blow-by system' causing 'Oil in environment'."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Oil leakage over time' with cause 'Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)' and effect 'Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches that of 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect, with identical preventive and detective measures. The product category (gas engines) and functional context are consistent. Therefore, the retrieved ratings can be used as a baseline. Considering the transition to an updated product type (Type 6) which might have incremental design or process improvements but no indication of major changes that would alter severity or detection, the ratings are kept consistent. The existing preventive measures (1d analysis, oil system design docs, hydraulic and thermal system controls) and detective measures (oil functional test, endurance run with oil pressure monitoring, field validation) are strong but detection requires targeted inspections rather than fully automated or certain detection. Severity remains at 7 as the failure still leads to reduced tribological function adversely affecting engine operation and customer satisfaction significantly but not violating regulations or causing immediate critical failure. Occurrence remains low (2) due to effective preventive controls on the oil circuit design that minimize defect introduction likelihood. Detection remains moderate (5) as failures can be caught through targeted functional and endurance testing but not guaranteed before customer use. Hence, the ratings derived from the prior Gas Engine Type 4 context are appropriate with minimal or no adjustment."
Position of blow-by extraction,Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 system (same product category: Gas Engine, same subsystem: Engine Block, same system element: Crankcase, identical function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect). The preventive and detective measures also match closely, ensuring the reliability of the retrieved ratings. Severity rating is consistent for the failure effect 'Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function' and same preventive/detective measures lead to the same occurrence and detection ratings. Minor difference between engine types Type 4 and Type 6 is considered negligible for risk rating, so original ratings are used directly."
O-ring aging,Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, with failure mode 'Oil leakage over time' in the 'Crankcase' element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem, failure cause 'O-ring aging', and failure effect 'Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function'. The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 shows the exact same failure mode, cause, element, function, and failure effect with similar preventive and detective measures. Minor differences in product version (Type 4 vs Type 6) and potential design improvements exist but the fundamental failure scenario, measures, and impacts are consistent. Severity rating of 7 is appropriate given the impact on tribological function and oil pressure, consistent with the retrieved rating. Occurrence rating in the retrieved data varies between 2 and 3 depending on the exact failure mode context but mainly 2 to 3 for 'O-ring aging' with preventive actions like supplier involvement, design per specification, and maintenance schedule alignment, which match target measures and suggest low likelihood but not negligible. Detection ratings are around 4 to 5 in retrieved data considering leakage tests, endurance runs, field validations, and assembly tests, all existing in the target system detection strategy, supporting mid-level detection rating due to detection mainly in targeted inspections and tests but not fully certain before failure. Considering these points, the retrieved ratings are adapted with Occurrence rated more conservatively as 3 (slightly higher than some retrieved 2s), Detection as 5 to reflect targeted inspection reliance, and Severity as 7 due to consistent impact severity. Thus, using retrieved data adapted reasonably to target product context leads to precise and consistent FMEA risk ratings."
Liquid sealing degradation,Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function,"EXACT_MATCH based on a direct match of Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Sealing against leakages oil), Failure Mode (Oil leakage over time), Failure Cause (Liquid sealing degradation), Failure Effect (Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function). The preventive measure ('Liquid sealant specification') and detective measures ('Endurance run' and 'Field validation') match exactly the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. Thus, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be used directly. Severity is consistent at 7 for diminishing tribological function impacting oil pressure, occurrence is low (2) due to effective liquid sealant specification, and detection is moderate (5) because detection relies on targeted inspection like endurance run and field validation. No context differences require rating adjustments."
Position of blow-by system,Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function,"EXACT_MATCH based on high similarity with retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase for failure mode 'Oil leakage over time' caused by 'Position of blow-by system' affecting 'Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function'. The product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect match exactly or with negligible naming variation. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar and largely overlapping. Therefore, the same risk ratings are applicable, with verification against current measures confirming consistency."
Thermal boundary conditions,Oil in environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows an exact match in subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode ('Oil leakage over time from cylinder head'), failure cause (Thermal boundary conditions), and failure effect ('Oil in environment'). Preventive and detective measures are very similar to the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Given the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem, and system element, and identical failure mode, cause, and effect, the context is highly analogous. Minor updates in engine model version (Type 6 vs Type 4) do not fundamentally change risk characteristics or customer impact but may slightly improve detection by adding 'Thermal survey' and 'Blow-by functional test' in detective measures. Preventive measures and their effectiveness remain similar. Therefore, severity and occurrence ratings from Type 4 are applied directly. Detection rating is slightly improved (from 5 to 4) due to additional thermal survey and blow-by functional test enhancing likelihood of detecting failure cause before customer impact. This adjustment aligns with the rating definitions that a detection rating of 4 indicates high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes, better than detection only through targeted inspection (rating 5)."
Thermal boundary conditions,Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches exactly the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode ('Oil leakage over time from cylinder head'), failure cause ('Thermal boundary conditions'), and failure effect ('Decreasing oil pressure leading to diminishing tribological function') with the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The preventive and detective measures are essentially identical, except the target context includes additional detective measures ('Thermal survey' and 'Blow-by functional test') that are referenced in the retrieved data but omitted in some entries. Given the closely related product type, identical functional and failure context, and largely overlapping measures, the original ratings are highly applicable with minor verification. Severity is consistent at 7 due to customer dissatisfaction from reduced tribological function. Occurrence is rated 4 (occasional) reflecting effective preventive measures like design practices and simulations. Detection remains 5 indicating detection relies on targeted inspections (endurance run and field validation) but no certain detection prior to field performance. The additional detective measures in the target context improve detection marginally but do not justify a rating shift, hence Detection stays at 5. Overall, ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 context are directly transposable with slight confidence gain from extra detection means, consistent with SIMILAR_CONTEXT. "
Bolted joint design,Oil contamination of the environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a bolted joint design failure cause leading to oil contamination of the environment from the crankcase sealing. Retrieved data shows multiple highly similar failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 within the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and function (Sealing against leakages oil), specifically the failure mode 'Oil leakage' caused by 'Bolted joint design'. Although the target product is a newer type (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category, subsystem, element, and failure cause context, as well as preventive and detective measures, are very close. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are highly applicable but warrant slight adaptation considering potential improvements or changes in design and detection in the newer engine type. 

Severity: The failure effect is 'Oil contamination of the environment'. For similar failures related to oil leak to environment in Type 4 engines with bolted joint design cause, the severity ratings listed range from 4 ('Oil in environment') to 7 ('Oil leak into environment'). Oil contamination of environment usually causes process disturbance and some regulatory concern but not severe financial damage or regulatory violations here, consistent with a severity rating around 4-7. The retrieved data for 'Oil leakage' and bolted joint design indicates severity 4 for 'Oil in environment'. Given the failure effect stated, severity 4 is consistent and appropriate to keep.

Occurrence: For 'Bolted joint design' under failure mode 'Oil leakage' in Type 4 engines, the occurrence rating is consistently 4, reflecting an occasional occurrence considering existing preventive measures like FEA, VDI 2230 standards, simulation, and joint preload measurements. Our target system has similar or the same preventive measures. Slight improvements in newer Type 6 may lower occurrence slightly but since bolted joint still requires careful design and can fail occasionally, Occurrence = 4 remains valid.

Detection: Detection ratings for 'Bolted joint design' in the retrieved failures with similar detective measures (pre-load measurement, vibration measurement) are rating 3, indicating high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes. The target system has 'Bolted joint pre-load measurement' as detective measure, consistent with this rating.

Summary: Using retrieved data with direct matching failure cause, failure mode, and similar product category and subsystem, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings (4, 4, 3) are well supported. No significant adjustments are required given identical preventive and detective measures and similar failure effect.
"
Bolted joint design,Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 closely matches the target context Gas Engine Type 6 for the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', same failure mode ('Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase'), same failure cause ('Bolted joint design'), and highly similar failure effect ('Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure' vs 'Gas: Decrease in combustion efficiency due to decreasing pressure'). Preventive and detective measures are identical between target and retrieved data, notably including FEA, VDI 2230, bolted joint and cylinder head design calculations, and bolted joint pre-load measurement. Given strong similarity in system element identity, function, failure mode, failure cause, effect, and measures, the existing rating from Gas Engine Type 4 should be adapted with minor consideration to possible slight differences in engine type or operating environment. Since severity categorization depends on customer impact: decrease in combustion efficiency causing reduced engine performance and potential customer dissatisfaction fits the '7' severity category (reduced service, dissatisfaction). Occurrence rating at '4' reflects occasional occurrence with effective prevention; this aligns with detailed preventive measures in place. Detection rating at '3' (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) fits the bolted joint pre-load measurement method and is consistent across similar cases. Therefore, the adapted ratings for Gas Engine Type 6 remain consistent with Gas Engine Type 4's data. Minor differences in product generation or type do not justify rating changes. Hence, use retrieved ratings directly with confirmation through analytical reasoning."
Bolted joint design,Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase sealing failure) closely aligns with retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, same system element, same failure mode and cause, and same preventive and detective measures. Minor differences in product version (Type 6 vs. Type 4) likely do not significantly affect failure effect severity or the effectiveness of preventive/detective measures since design concepts and analytical methods (FEA, VDI 2230, bolted joint standards) are consistent. Thus, we adopt the retrieved ratings with no reduction. Severity is rated '7' consistent with overheating causing component failure (significant customer impact but not regulatory violation). Occurrence is '4' (occasional) reflecting robust preventive analysis and design methods applied to bolted joint design. Detection is '3' (high likelihood of detection in subsequent process) supported by bolted joint pre-load measurement protocol. This fits the defined rating schema and context effectively."
O-Ring material selection,Oil contamination of the environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from similar Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase sealing failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' with failure cause 'O-Ring material selection'. The product category, subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure cause, and preventive/detective measures match exactly (only engine type differs but is functionally very similar). Thus, the existing risk ratings directly apply. The severity rating of 7 reflects the impact of oil contamination of the environment causing customer dissatisfaction and environmental concerns. Occurrence rating of 2 reflects the effectiveness of preventive measures 'Supplier recommendation, O-Ring calculation, O-Ring specification / Material selection' in minimizing likelihood. Detection rating of 2 is consistent with 'Leakage test, Endurance run (Leakage check)' enabling high likelihood of detection before customer impact."
Material plasticity,Oil contamination of the environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, with the exact failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' and failure cause 'Material plasticity' leading to failure effect 'Oil contamination of the environment'. All match criteria for target product category and functional context are met, allowing direct use of retrieved ratings. Preventive measures ('FEA', 'Material measurement FPQ', 'Fuji film test', 'Material characterization/qualification') and detective measures ('Overload test', 'Endurance run', 'Bolt extension check test', 'Vibration measurement') align perfectly with those documented. Severity rating is consistent with impact of environmental oil contamination causing customer dissatisfaction and regulatory attention. Occurrence rating reflects low likelihood due to strong preventive approach. Detection rating reflects moderate difficulty, requiring targeted inspections before delivery. Thus, extracted ratings from the retrieved exact match are used without modification."
O-Ring aging,Oil contamination of the environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on strong similarity: The target failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' in 'Crankcase' of 'Engine Block' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('O-Ring aging'), and failure effect ('Oil contamination of the environment'). Preventive and detective measures listed are consistent with those in the retrieved data, confirming applicability. Thus, risk ratings from retrieved data are directly applicable without adjustment."
Combustion system high pfp events,Oil contamination of the environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' in 'Crankcase' of 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches exactly the retrieved context from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same product category (gas engine), same system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('Combustion system high pfp events'), failure effect ('Oil contamination of the environment'), and similar preventive and detective measures. Thus, the risk ratings from the retrieved data are directly applicable. The severity rating is consistent at 7 for this failure effect (oil contamination of environment causing customer dissatisfaction and reduced service with environmental impact). The occurrence rating is 4 reflecting occasional occurrence considering the preventive measures: 'Bolted joint design practice' and 'Cylinder head design practice'. The detection rating is 4 given the existing detective measures: 'Cylinder head pulse rig test' and 'Bolt extension test (MCE)', providing a high likelihood of detection before customer delivery. Hence, all ratings align well with the current context and measures."
Position of blow-by system,Failure of external system components,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The retrieved data provides an exact match for the target context, with all key attributes matching exactly except for a slight product version difference (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6), which is acceptable given the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. The preventive and detective measures are the same and context very similar, so the risk ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 context apply directly with no adjustment needed. Severity is consistent with a serious impact causing failure of external components (rating 7), occurrence is occasional failure likelihood due to effective prevention (rating 4), and detection is moderately good (rating 4) from the combined tests and vibration monitoring measures."
Position of blow-by system,Structural failure of supporting parts,"EXACT_MATCH based on direct retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4 matching all key elements (Subsystem: Engine Block, SystemElement: Crankcase, Function: Transmission of energy between crankcase and CCV, FailureMode: High vibration of crankcase to blow-by system, FailureCause: Position of blow-by system, FailureEffect: Structural failure of supporting parts) with highly similar preventive and detective measures in place. The preventive and detective measures in the target system context are identical to the retrieved context's measures, supporting direct reuse of the risk ratings. Severity is consistent with the criticality of structural failure (rated 7), occurrence reflects occasional occurrence despite preventive measures (rated 4), and detection reflects high likelihood of detection through tests before delivery but not completely certain (rated 4)."
Bolted joint design,Oil leakage through failure in the connection to CCV system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Vibration and thermal transfer to CCV piping causing structural failure' with failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and failure effect 'Oil leakage through failure in the connection to CCV system' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase matches very closely with retrieved FMEA data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' crankcase subsystem with the same failure mode and cause. Both are within the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and function (energy transmission between crankcase and CCV). Preventive and detective measures are also very similar (VDI 2230 calculations, FEA simulation, ultrasonic bolt measurement, and validation tests). Given the high similarity but a potential slight increase in complexity or operational severity for Type 6 engines, it is reasonable to keep severity rating consistent. Occurrence is slightly adapted upwards to reflect potentially increased operating conditions or complexity in Type 6 engines, but preventive measures remain effective enough to keep the occurrence moderate. Detection measures in both contexts are quite robust with pre-load measurements and functional testing; detection rating is kept equivalent or slightly better due to advanced inspection techniques mentioned in the target context. Hence, severity is kept the same at 4, occurrence slightly adjusted to 5 (reflecting occasional occurrence despite strong preventive measures), detection kept at 3 (high detection likelihood given proactive measures)."
Water jacket design,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved context corresponds to the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Allow for venting locations for coolant circuit), Failure Mode (Air in the coolant circuit system), Failure Cause (Water jacket design), and Failure Effect (Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency), with exactly the same preventive and detective measures. Therefore, the existing risk ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 can be directly used without adjustment. The Severity rating of 5 reflects moderate process disturbance and some customer issues due to decreased coolant efficiency. Occurrence rating of 4 indicates occasional occurrence considering the effectiveness of the various design and simulation preventive measures. Detection rating of 2 means the failure cause is highly likely to be detected with current coolant system functional tests and endurance inspections before customer delivery."
Coolant type and maintenance,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH with thorough verification: The retrieved data show an exact match for all key attributes (Product Category: Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6 – same product category family and core function), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Allow for venting locations for coolant circuit), Failure Mode (Air in the coolant circuit system), Failure Cause (Coolant type and maintenance), Failure Effect (Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency), and existing preventive & detective measures which also match exactly. Considering the only difference is the product version (Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product family and no indication of changed conditions or measures effectiveness, the extracted ratings are directly applicable. Severity rated consistently as 5 corresponds to moderate process disturbance but limited customer impact, suitable for coolant efficiency reduction without direct safety or regulatory breach. Occurrence at 2 reflects well-implemented preventive measures (supplier recommendations, guidelines, maintenance plans) effectively reducing failure cause probability to unlikely. Detection at 5 means detection is possible but only through targeted inspections (endurance runs, field validation, system tests), consistent with existing detective measures. Therefore, no rating adjustments necessary."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, function for coolant venting) is essentially identical in function and failure mode/cause/effect to the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode ('Air in the coolant circuit system'), failure cause ('Coolant system venting design/ strategy'), and failure effect ('Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency'). Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines), and the subsystem and function match exactly. Preventive and detective measures listed in target and retrieved data overlap significantly (TA venting practices, 3D Model filling simulation, W 8080 A0 maintenance instruction, Endurance runs, Field validation, Coolant system functional tests). Given this high degree of match and no major context or measure differences, using the retrieved ratings directly is appropriate. The severity rating of 5 reflects moderate process disturbance and decrease in coolant efficiency; occurrence rating of 5 indicates occasional occurrence despite existing preventive controls; detection rating of 5 means detection occurs only through targeted inspections, consistent with the detective measures. This provides an accurate and consistent risk rating for the FMEA."
Engine cooling filling process,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data shows an exact functional and failure mode/cause/effect match for 'Air in the coolant circuit system' caused by 'Engine cooling filling process' resulting in 'Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency' but in 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both engines belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, cause, and effect. Preventive and detective measures are also identical. Thus, this is a very close match but not an exact product match, classified as SIMILAR_CONTEXT. 

Severity is consistent at 5, indicating moderate process disturbance and reduced coolant efficiency affecting some customers but not violating regulations or causing critical damage. 

Occurrence rating is 4, indicating occasional occurrence despite existing preventive measures such as maintenance instruction (W 8080 A0) and CFD analysis of water jacket. This reflects practical risk considering the filling process still allows some air intrusion occasionally.

Detection rating is 5, indicating detection only through targeted inspections such as coolant system functional tests, endurance runs with technician follow-up, and field service validation pertaining to venting ease. This detection level aligns with available detective measures and no indication of higher or lower detectability.

No adjustments needed for the target system ('Gas Engine Type 6') because no substantial differences in operating environment, customer impact, or measures effectiveness against the failure cause are identified. Slight engine type variation does not imply significant risk change.

Final ratings used from retrieved data, consistent with rating definitions and system similarity analysis."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Overheating of system components due to air bubbles,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data provides exact matches for all key attributes except for the product variant (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Target Gas Engine Type 6). Both belong to the same Product Category (Gas Engine), same Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function, Failure Mode (Air in coolant circuit), Failure Cause (Coolant system venting design/strategy), and Failure Effect (Overheating due to air bubbles). Preventive and detective measures are highly similar, with the target system having some additional maintenance instructions and CFD measures that improve the design and maintenance rigor. Thus, baseline ratings can be adapted from Gas Engine Type 4 data. Severity remains the same at 5 indicating process disturbance and problems for some customers (consistent failure effect impact). Occurrence is kept at 5 (occasional occurrence) because existing preventive measures such as TA venting practices and 3D simulation remain largely the same, though the addition of maintenance instructions and CFD might marginally improve occurrence but not enough to reduce below 5. Detection remains at 5 reflecting detection by targeted inspections and endurance runs of low flow areas, consistent across both datasets. Overall, ratings align well, and slight improvements in preventive measures justify maintaining but not lowering risk ratings."
Water jacket design,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Crankcase' system element with identical function '(Ensure that no air is in the coolant circuit)', failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system', failure cause 'Water jacket design' and failure effect 'Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency'. The retrieved data shows the same preventive and detective measures with Severity=5, Occurrence=4, Detection=2. Given the highly similar product category (gas engines), highly comparable subsystem, identical system element, function, failure mode, cause, effect, and matching preventive/detective measures, direct usage of these risk ratings is consistent and appropriate without adjustments."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with the failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system' caused by 'Coolant system venting design/ strategy' in the Crankcase of the Engine Block subsystem. The retrieved data includes exact failure mode, cause, and effect from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem and element, with very similar preventive and detective measures. Considering the same product category and functional context, this is a strong similarity case. Severity rating of 5 from Type 4 applies well, as oxidation of coolant leading to reduced efficiency is moderate impact causing process disturbances but no regulatory or severe safety impact. Occurrence is rated as 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting the effectiveness of existing preventive measures like TA venting practices and 3D simulation, which reduce but do not eliminate the failure cause. Detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) is consistent with existing detective measures involving endurance runs and field validation focusing on low flow velocity and venting points. No Type 6 specific data suggests major adjustments; given comparable design and maintenance practices, the risk rating from Type 4 is adopted with no changes."
Engine cooling filling process,Oxidation of coolant leading to decreasing coolant efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, Function to ensure no air in coolant circuit) and failure scenario matches very closely with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect. Preventive and detective measures are identical. Given the similarity across gas engine family products with comparable design and maintenance principles, the retrieved risk ratings (Severity 5, Occurrence 4, Detection 5) are appropriate and applicable. Slight adjustment is not required as the preventive instructions and CFD analyses plus detection testing and field validation equivalently mitigate and detect the failure cause. Severity rating 5 reflects moderate impact on coolant efficiency with process disturbance and customer problems, consistent with failure effect of oxidation decreasing coolant efficiency. Occurrence rating 4 corresponds to occasional occurrence with existing preventive measures like maintenance instruction and CFD. Detection rating 5 indicates detection mainly through targeted inspections like functional tests and endurance runs, consistent with described detective measures. Therefore, using the retrieved ratings without adjustment is valid and consistent with rating definitions and system similarity criteria."
Water jacket design,Overheating of system components due to air bubbles,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Ensure that no air is in coolant circuit), failure mode (Air in coolant circuit system), failure cause (Water jacket design), and failure effect (Overheating of system components due to air bubbles). The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved context match exactly with the target system (DP 34 - Crankcase, DP 18 - cylinder liner, DP 28 - Hydraulic system, CFD Analysis (water jacket), 1d simulation (coolant circuit)) and detective controls (Coolant system functional test, Endurance run (inspection of parts)). Thus, severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be directly applied. The severity rating 5 corresponds to 'process disturbance, problems for some customers' consistent with overheating impact. Occurrence rating 4 indicates 'occasional occurrence' given preventive measures moderately reduce likelihood. Detection rating 2 means 'certain detection in subsequent processes' due to functional testing and endurance run. These ratings are consistent and suitable for Gas Engine Type 6 of same product category and highly similar system context, justifying direct use without adjustment."
Coolant type and maintenance,Overheating of system components due to air bubbles,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 matches the target failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system' in the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), same function ('Ensure that no air is in the coolant circuit'), same failure cause (Coolant type and maintenance), and same failure effect (Overheating of system components due to air bubbles). The only difference is the product version (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6) within the same product category (Gas Engines). Preventive and detective measures are identical, implying same effectiveness. Therefore, baseline ratings from Type 4 apply directly. 

Severity rating of 5 is appropriate since this causes overheating leading to process disturbance and potential problem for some customers but no severe regulatory or financial violation. Occurrence is rated at 2 indicating low likelihood due to effective preventive measures (supplier recommendations, coolant guideline, maintenance plan). Detection is rated at 5 indicating detection is possible but only through targeted inspections (endurance runs, field validation, system tests). 

No adjustment needed for severity, occurrence, or detection because the context, failure mechanisms, impact, and controls are highly similar. This analysis aligns with the defined decision matrix and rating definitions."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Overheating of system components due to air bubbles,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase) and failure scenario (Air in the coolant circuit due to coolant system venting design/strategy causing overheating) is very similar to the retrieved context (Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect). Both share identical preventive and detective measures. Although the product type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the functional and design context within the same product category (Gas Engines) and identical subsystem and failure scenario justifies reusing the retrieved ratings with no adjustment needed because the severity impact, likelihood, and detection capability are consistent given the same measures and system function."
Engine cooling filling process,Overheating of system components due to air bubbles,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data includes failure modes, causes, effects, and risk ratings that exactly match the target system context in terms of Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect. The preventive and detective measures in the target system match those in the retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data. Therefore, the existing risk ratings for Severity (5), Occurrence (4), and Detection (5) are valid and consistent with current measures and can be applied directly. The severity of 5 aligns with the impact of overheating causing process disturbance and problems for some customers. Occurrence of 4 matches occasional occurrence given preventive maintenance instructions and CFD simulation. Detection of 5 indicates detection possible only through targeted inspection measures such as functional tests and endurance runs, consistent with the listed detective actions."
Water jacket design,Overheating of cylinder leading to engine failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context matches Gas Engine category, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner, failure mode Too low coolant feed to cylinder liner, failure cause Water jacket design, and failure effect Overheating of cylinder leading to engine failure except for product version (Gas Engine Type 6 vs retrieved Gas Engine Type 4). Preventive and detective measures are identical. Retrieved risk ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are Severity=8, Occurrence=4, Detection=3. Given the similar design, function, failure cause, and overlapping preventive/detective controls, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable. Severity remains 8 due to significant customer/system impact (overheating causing engine failure). Occurrence is moderate (4) reflecting occasional occurrence considering effective preventive design and simulation controls. Detection rating 3 is justified by existing functional tests and endurance inspections with high likelihood of detection before customer impact. No significant operational environment or design differences noted to warrant deviation from retrieved ratings."
Coolant type and maintenance,Overheating of cylinder leading to engine failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data includes an exact match in all key aspects except the Product is 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both are gas engines in the same product category with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Too low coolant feed to cylinder liner), failure cause (Coolant type and maintenance), and failure effect (Overheating of cylinder leading to engine failure). Preventive and detective measures listed are identical. Given the high similarity, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are highly applicable to Type 6. However, a small adjustment consideration is given due to potential differences in engine design maturity or coolant system robustness between Type 4 and Type 6. Assuming equal or improved preventive controls and similar detection capability for Type 6, the previously retrieved ratings (Severity 8, Occurrence 2, Detection 5) remain fully appropriate without change. Thus, severity is maintained at 8 reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and potential engine failure risk; occurrence remains low likelihood (2) reflecting effective preventive measures; detection remains moderate (5) since detection is possible mostly via targeted inspection and testing measures prior to failure. This conclusion aligns fully with rating definitions and system similarity decision matrix."
Water circuit design,Overheating of cylinder liner and/or cylinder head leads to scuffing/cavitation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase with failure mode 'Local stagnation of coolant' caused by 'Water circuit design', leading to overheating and scuffing/cavitation. The retrieved exact matching failure mode and cause from 'Gas Engine Type 4' is highly relevant, with matching subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, effect, and very similar preventive/detective measures. Both share the same product category (Gas Engine series) and subsystem context (Engine Block), differing by engine generation/version only. Given the high similarity in preventive and detective measures and identical failure effect severity context (overheating causing scuffing/cavitation), the severity rating of 8 remains valid.

Occurrence rating in the Gas Engine Type 4 context is 4 (occasional occurrence) considering preventive measures like '1d analysis', 'DP34 Crankcase', 'DP48 Piping', and 'CFD Analysis'. Since the Type 6 engine presumably uses similar or improved designs and preventive measures (no indications of increased risk), the occurrence rating of 4 is appropriate to keep.

Detection rating in the retrieved data is 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent test phases such as 'Coolant system functional test', 'Endurance run', 'Field validation'). This matches the existing detective measures described for Type 6. Thus, the detection rating is also kept at 3.

Hence, due to strong contextual match with just a product version difference and consistent measures and effects, direct application of retrieved ratings with minor confirmation is justified."
Coolant type and maintenance,Overheating of cylinder liner and/or cylinder head leads to scuffing/cavitation,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar product category (Gas Engine), same Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (Crankcase), Function, FailureMode (Local stagnation of coolant), FailureCause (Coolant type and maintenance), FailureEffect (Overheating leading to scuffing/cavitation), and identical preventive and detective measures. The retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data gives Severity=8, Occurrence=2, Detection=5 which aligns well with the target context as Type 6 engines likely have similar coolant circuit designs and impact on customers. Preventive measures effectively reduce occurrence to unlikely (2), but detection is moderate (5) due to reliance on endurance and field quality measurements rather than guaranteed detection methods. Severity rating 8 is appropriate due to customer dissatisfaction and reduced service caused by overheating and damage. Therefore, no rating adjustment is needed; retrieved ratings are directly applicable and consistent."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Overheating of cylinder liner and/or cylinder head leads to scuffing/cavitation,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (coolant flow to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Coolant system venting design/strategy), and failure effect (Overheating leading to scuffing/cavitation) matches the target system context almost exactly. The product type is very similar (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6), both presumably within the same product category and functional system context. Preventive and detective measures are identical ('TA venting practices' and '3D Model filling simulation' as preventive; 'Endurance run' and 'Field validation' as detective). Therefore, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable without needing adjustment. The severity rating of 8 reflects significant customer impact (reduced service, dissatisfied customers due to overheating and component damage), occurrence rating of 5 indicates occasional failure considering current preventive measures, and detection rating 5 shows detection via targeted inspections (endurance runs and field validations) but not earlier in the process, consistent with the current setup. Hence, ratings from the retrieved data are used directly, meeting all outlined rating definitions and context criteria."
Engine cooling filling process,Overheating of cylinder liner and/or cylinder head leads to scuffing/cavitation,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the failure mode 'Local stagnation of coolant' on the 'Crankcase' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with the exact failure cause 'Engine cooling filling process' and identical preventive and detective measures matches the target system context of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely. Both are gas engines within the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect, sharing the same preventive and detective controls. Given minimal expected differences between engine Type 4 and Type 6 in these respects, the exact retrieved ratings (Severity=8, Occurrence=4, Detection=5) are applicable without adjustment."
Coolant system flow rate,Overheating of cylinder liner and/or cylinder head leads to scuffing/cavitation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 matches exactly the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Coolant system flow rate) and failure effect (Overheating leading to scuffing/cavitation). The product differs only in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) but belongs to the same product category (gas engines) and has a very similar operational and functional context. Preventive measures ('CFD analysis') and detective measures ('Coolant functional test') are identical. Therefore, the context is highly similar and rating adaptation is minimal.

Severity rating of 8 is consistent with the severe overheating and component damage causing customer dissatisfaction and potential reduced engine life, matching engine severity categorization.

Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional) reflects the realistic probability considering the effectiveness of CFD analysis in design but cannot eliminate the cause completely. This aligns well with the existing preventive measure.

Detection rating of 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent process) fits well because coolant functional tests exist to detect flow issues before delivery.

Hence, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are transferable and valid with no adjustments needed."
Water circuit design,Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data shows an exact match in all relevant aspects except the product variant (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6). The subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Water circuit design), and failure effect (Thermal distortion leading to mechanical damage and engine failure) match exactly. Preventive and detective measures listed are also identical, indicating comparable mitigation strategies. Given the same product category (gas engines) and similar subsystem functional context, the previously established ratings can be adapted directly. 

Severity: Consistent severity rating of 8 is appropriate given the serious mechanical damage and potential engine failure impact on end customer.
Occurrence: Rated at 4 (occasional) reflecting effective but not absolute preventive measures (1D analysis, DP34 Crankcase, DP48 Piping, CFD Analysis) reducing failure likelihood but not eliminating it.
Detection: Rated at 3 (high likelihood of detection) due to comprehensive detective measures including endurance runs, field validation, and functional tests, enabling early detection before customer impact.

No reasoned adjustment is needed beyond minor confirmation for the target system context due to high similarity and identical measures."
Water jacket design,Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Local stagnation of coolant' with failure cause 'Water jacket design' and failure effect 'Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure' exactly matches the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect context. The preventive and detective measures in the target system are identical to those in the retrieved data. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be directly adopted, consistent with the rating definitions and the presence of effective preventive and detective measures."
Coolant type and maintenance,Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target context 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode ('Local stagnation of coolant'), failure cause ('Coolant type and maintenance'), and failure effect ('Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure'). The preventive and detective measures are identical as well. Given the strong similarity in product category (gas engines), subsystem, system element, failure mode, cause, effect, and measures, the retrieved risk ratings are directly applicable without adjustment. Therefore, severity is rated as 8 (customers experience reduced service and dissatisfaction due to severe mechanical damage risk), occurrence is 2 reflecting unlikely cause occurrence given effective preventive measures (supplier guidance, maintenance plans), and detection is 5 indicating detection only by targeted inspections (endurance runs, field validation, coolant system tests), consistent with the retrieved data and measures."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on high similarity of product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Coolant system venting design/ strategy), and failure effect (Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure). The retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 perfectly matches all aspects except for a minor product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) but within the same product family and engineering context. Preventive and detective measures are identical. Severity rating of 8 properly reflects reduced service and customer dissatisfaction due to potential mechanical damage and possible engine failure. Occurrence of 5 corresponds to occasional occurrence considering implemented TA venting practices and 3D model venting simulation. Detection rating of 5 indicates detection through targeted inspections like endurance run and field validation, which aligns with current detective measures. No adjustments are required."
Engine cooling filling process,Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure,"EXACT_MATCH identified with Gas Engine Type 4 data: Product category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect align exactly with the target system except product type evolved from Type 4 to Type 6. Since the subsystem, system element, functional context, failure mode, cause, effect, and existing preventive/detective measures are identical, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable. Preventive measures ('W 8080 A0 - Maintenance instruction for cooling water circuit', 'CFD of water jacket') and detective measures ('Coolant system functional test', 'Endurance run (technician follow-up on ease of venting)', 'Field validation (service follow-up on ease of venting)') match exactly. Therefore, use the retrieved Severity 8, Occurrence 4, and Detection 5 ratings without adjustment according to the rating methodology."
Coolant system flow rate,Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the failure mode 'Local stagnation of coolant' in the crankcase of the engine block subsystem with the same failure cause 'Coolant system flow rate' and failure effect 'Thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head leading to mechanical damage evtl. engine failure' is directly parallel to the target Gas Engine Type 6 context. Both share the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, preventive measure (CFD analysis), and detective measure (Coolant functional test). Minor differences between engine types 4 and 6 in cooling system design are not specified and thus assumed similar. Therefore, the severity rating remains consistent at 8 reflecting significant customer impact and potential mechanical damage. The occurrence rating is kept at 5, indicating an occasional failure cause occurrence despite existing preventive CFD analysis. The detection rating remains 3, corresponding to a high likelihood of detection through functional coolant testing prior to customer delivery. Hence, the retrieved risk ratings are appropriate for the target context with no adjustments needed."
Water circuit design,Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, providing coolant flow route to cylinder liner, failure mode: Local stagnation of coolant, failure cause: Water circuit design, failure effect: boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head) closely matches retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures are also identical or very similar (e.g., '1d analysis', 'DP34 Crankcase', 'DP48 Piping', 'CFD Analysis'; detective measures including endurance runs and coolant system functional tests). The slight difference in product generation (Type 6 vs Type 4) is within the same product category and functional domain, making this a similar context scenario. Rating adaptation reasoning: Severity rating of 6 from Type 4 data aligns well with the described thermal distortion effect that is serious but not causing immediate engine stop or regulatory violation, consistent with the failure effect severity definition (process disturbance/significant component damage but not catastrophic). Occurrence rating of 4 (occasional occurrence) is consistent given the established preventive measures, which reduce but do not eliminate the failure cause (water circuit design complexity). Detection rating of 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) fits with robust endurance and functional testing measures in place for this failure cause and mode. Therefore, the ratings from Type 4 context are applicable without significant adjustment."
Water jacket design,Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head,"EXACT_MATCH with Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Water jacket design), and failure effect (Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head). Preventive and detective measures for both contexts are identical. Given the very close match (only difference in Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4, same product category and functional context), the previously retrieved risk ratings apply directly without adjustment."
Coolant type and maintenance,Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data is for Gas Engine Type 4 and the target is Gas Engine Type 6, both within the same product category (Gas Engines) and identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Coolant type and maintenance), and failure effect (Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion). Preventive and detective measures match exactly. Therefore, the existing risk ratings from Type 4 are directly applicable but need review for possible minor context differences in engine generation or operating conditions. Given no indication of change in measures effectiveness or severity impact, the original ratings are retained unadjusted."
Coolant system venting design/ strategy,Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match in subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Coolant system venting design/ strategy), and failure effect (Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head). The retrieved context is from Gas Engine Type 4, while the target is Gas Engine Type 6, which are closely related products within the same product category (gas engines) and similar functional contexts. Preventive measures (TA venting practices, 3D Model filling simulation) and detective measures (Endurance run, Field validation focused on low flow velocity areas) are identical, indicating comparable risk control effectiveness. Severity rating of 6 is consistent with a localized process disturbance causing thermal distortion but not yet severe enough for major engine failure. Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence) reflects that despite the established preventive measures, some risk remains due to complexity of venting design. Detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) also aligns with endurance runs and field validations as detective methods. Since the product has advanced from Type 4 to Type 6, no significant change in operating environment or failure impact is expected, thus retaining same ratings is reasonable."
Engine cooling filling process,Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner), failure mode (Local stagnation of coolant), failure cause (Engine cooling filling process), and failure effect (Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head) matches almost exactly except for the product generation version (Type 4 vs Type 6). Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and operate in similar thermal/cooling contexts. Preventive and detective measures listed are identical and appear equally effective. No significant operational environment or customer impact differences are indicated that would affect severity. Therefore, the existing ratings from Type 4 context can be applied directly, confirming severity at 6 (process disturbance with possible problems for customers), occurrence at 4 (occasional occurrence considering preventive maintenance instructions and CFD analyses), and detection at 5 (detection only by targeted inspections such as functional tests and endurance runs). Thus, the risk ratings remain consistent and valid for the target system context with minimal adjustment needed."
Coolant system flow rate,Boiling and circulation of bubbles leading to thermal distortion of cylinder liner & cylinder head,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, a close variant of the target Gas Engine Type 6, both sharing the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures match exactly (CFD analysis and Coolant functional test). Minor generational or design improvements could exist between Type 4 and Type 6 but no explicit info on changed measure effectiveness or failure severity is provided. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are directly applicable with no rating adjustment needed. Severity rating 6 aligns with the moderate process/customer impact definition (thermal distortion without immediate severe engine failure). Occurrence rating 5 reflects occasional failure cause despite CFD preventive measure. Detection rating 3 represents high likelihood of detection through coolant functional test. All ratings are consistent with the defined rating schema and prevent/detect measures effectiveness."
Cylinder head interface design,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Gas mixture leakage' caused by 'Cylinder head interface design' in the Crankcase of the Engine Block subsystem. The retrieved data shows an EXACT MATCH for Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, preventive and detective measures. Since the product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect are consistent, and preventive ('O-Ring calculation', '3D Model analysis', 'O-Ring specification') and detective ('Endurance run (leakage check)') measures match, this is a very close match but not exact product. The Type 6 engine might have slightly different operating conditions or tolerances than Type 4. However, given the strong similarity and the exact match of measures, the previous risk ratings from Type 4 apply well here. Severity rating 4 is appropriate as the failure effect is 'Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss' causing process disturbance but no regulatory violation or severe financial damage. Occurrence rating 2 reflects the low likelihood due to effective preventive measures in place. Detection rating 2 reflects high likelihood of detecting leakage during endurance tests. The similarities in context strongly justify direct transfer of ratings with no adjustment needed. The minor product model difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) does not impact risk ratings materially in this scenario."
Cylinder head interface design,Gas release into environment causing potential safety hazards,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages gas mixture), failure mode (Gas mixture leakage), failure cause (Cylinder head interface design), and very similar failure effect (Gas release into environment causing potential safety hazards). Preventive measures ('O-Ring calculation', '3D Model analysis', 'O-Ring specification') and detective measures ('Endurance run (leakage check)') match or are very close to those documented. Severity ratings are consistent with the major safety concern of gas release (severity 10), occurrence is low due to effective preventive measures (occurrence 2), and detection is very good due to endurance and performance testing (detection 2). Hence, using the exact context ratings with confirmation that measurement methods and design controls remain similar."
O-ring aging,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6) and the retrieved exact failure mode and cause ('Gas mixture leakage over time' caused by 'O-ring aging' in the Crankcase of Engine Block, sealing against leakage of gas mixture) match closely with data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Although product versions differ (Type 6 vs Type 4), both belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and share the same functional and subsystem context, making the context similar. Preventive measures are comprehensive and largely overlapping, with the target having additional supplier involvement and design life maintenance alignment. Detective measures are identical ('Endurance run (leakage inspection)', 'Field validation (leakage inspection)'). Severity ratings are consistent at 4 due to 'Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss' being a moderate customer-impacting failure effect causing process disturbances. Occurrence in the retrieved data varies slightly between 2 and 3; due to the additional preventive measure rigor in the target system, occurrence rating is retained at 2, indicating unlikely occurrence. Detection rating in the retrieved context is 5 (detection only through targeted inspection). Given identical detective measures and failure mode/causes, detection rating remains at 5. Thus, severity, occurrence, and detection ratings are adapted with reasoned minor adjustment for preventive measures effectiveness in the newer engine type, but essentially consistent with retrieved data for similar context."
O-ring aging,Gas release into environment causing potential safety hazards,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system ('Gas Engine Type 6') and the retrieved data system ('Gas Engine Type 4') share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages gas mixture), failure mode (Gas mixture leakage over time), failure cause (O-ring aging), and failure effect (Gas release into environment causing potential safety hazards). The contexts differ only by engine model version, which is a similar application with likely similar design and validation approaches. Preventive and detective measures listed are also highly aligned between target and retrieved contexts, making the retrieved ratings applicable with minor adjustment due to potentially slightly newer design maturity or different engine scale in Type 6. Given the high consequence of gas release (safety hazard) the severity is consistent at 10. The occurrence rating can be set at 3 (low likelihood) as preventive measures are mature and consistent, similar to the retrieved data for O-ring aging in gas mixture leakage. Detection rating is likely better than 5 but not perfect because leakage inspection and endurance runs are used, so detection rating 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) fits well. Hence, retrieved ratings adapted: Severity 10, Occurrence 3, Detection 4."
Assembly process deficiencies and lack of design for assembly,Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment with associated contamination risks,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system ('Gas Engine Type 6', Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase sealing) and the retrieved data ('Gas Engine Type 4', Engine Block subsystem, components sealing crankcase or blow-by gas leakage) are within the same product category and functional context. The failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' matches closely in effect and cause, namely assembly process deficiencies and design for assembly. The failure effect in the retrieved data is oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment, matching the target failure effect of oil and blow-by gas leakage with contamination risks. Severity in retrieved data for similar failure effect is rated at 10 due to environmental contamination and associated regulatory/financial impact, while a similar failure with somewhat less critical effect (blow-by gas leakage) is rated 4-5 depending on mode nuance. Considering the target effect includes contamination risks and environmental impact (high severity), a severity of 10 is justified and aligned with the retrieved data. The occurrence rating for assembly process / design-for-assembly failure causes is consistently rated 5 in retrieved data, reflecting occasional occurrences despite multiple preventive measures like FPQ, drawings, instructions, and reliability plans. Similar preventive measures exist in the target system; no evidence suggests better or worse control effectiveness, so the occurrence rating of 5 is adapted. The detection rating for assembly process-related failures in retrieved data ranges 4 to 6 depending on the failure mode specifics; for 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' and assembly/design issues, detection is rated around 4-5 with measures like assembly trials, commissioning checklists, and functional testing. The target system has very similar detective measures. Given this, a detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) is appropriate. Overall, ratings are adapted from closely matching failure modes and causes, considering slightly escalated severity due to explicit contamination risk stated. This represents a SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating with analytical adjustment."
Crankcase design inadequacies affecting sealing,Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' in 'Crankcase' sealing (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase) closely matches failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4's Engine Block subsystem, especially failure mode id=6 ('Leakage of blow-by gas over time') and related modes in CCV and crankcase components. The failure cause 'Crankcase design inadequacies' and failure effect 'Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment' align well. Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical. However, Gas Engine Type 6 may have minor design or operating differences, but product category and subsystem are consistent, so ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are transferable with confidence. Severity is consistent at 4 (process disturbance, moderate environmental leakage); occurrence is rated 6 reflecting 'occasional occurrence' given existing preventive measures; detection is rated 5 indicating detection only by targeted tests (MCE functional testing, pressure monitoring, field validation), consistent with the diagnostic approaches. No retrieved exact match for Type 6, so SIMILAR_CONTEXT applies with minimal adjustment."
Piping design faults causing leakage paths,Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' on 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, caused by 'Piping design faults' resulting in 'Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment'. Retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, similar system element (Crankcase/CCV system integration), identical failure mode, the same failure cause 'Piping design', and identical failure effect (oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment) with preventive measures ('FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP048 Piping') and detective measures ('MCE Vibration and modal test', 'Field Validation', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring'). The similarity of system elements and product category (gas engines), identical failure modes, causes, and effects allow direct adaptation of the retrieved ratings. Since the product type changed from Type 4 to Type 6, which are likely similar in design and customer impact, no major severity or occurrence adjustments are needed. The severity rating 4 (process disturbance, problems for some customers) correctly reflects moderate environmental leakage impact, not a regulatory violation or severe financial damage. The occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood) fits well due to existing preventive FEA and design pipelines. The detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) aligns with the comprehensive multi-stage vibration and pressure monitoring measures in place. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are consistent and fully appropriate for the target system context."
Gasket and O-ring design errors or mismatch,Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' at the 'Crankcase' of 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure cause 'Gasket and O-ring design errors or mismatch' and effect 'Oil and blow-by gas leakage to environment' closely matches the retrieved data for 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' and 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Components related to CCV system and crankcase sealing. Preventive and detective measures provided in the target system exactly match those in retrieved data for cause 'Gasket & O-Ring design' with occurrence rating 2 and detection rating 2. Severity ratings in retrieved data for oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment are consistently 4. Considering Type 6 gas engine may have slightly more demanding sealing requirements due to engine improvements or emission regulations but no explicit increase in impact severity is indicated, severity rating remains consistent at 4. The effectiveness of preventive and detective measures in both contexts is similar due to matching specifications and tests. Therefore, occurrence remains at 2 (unlikely due to good gasket and O-ring design controls), and detection remains at 2 (high likelihood of detection through MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation). Thus, these ratings are directly adapted from retrieved similar context data with minimal adjustment."
Corrosion due to humidity exposure in the engine room,Coolant and oil leaks into environment and loss of fluid pressures,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' of the crankcase in the engine block subsystem caused by 'Corrosion due to humidity exposure', leading to coolant and oil leaks and loss of fluid pressures. Retrieved data shows a very similar context in 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem (engine block), system element (crankcase or closely related components sealing the crankcase), same failure mode and cause ('corrosion due to humidity exposure'), and same preventive ('Paint acc. to RAIP 43200') and detective measures ('Endurance run - inspection of parts and fluids', 'FPQ parts'). Failure effects with similar leaks and loss of pressure have severity ratings around 7. The occurrence rating for corrosion cause is consistently 2 considering the effectiveness of the preventive paint measure. Detection rating is 4 given the endurance run and final part quality inspections, allowing reasonably high likelihood of detection before delivery. Severity is aligned to 7 due to the coolant/oil leak into environment and pressure loss causing customer dissatisfaction and system degradation but not immediate regulatory violation or severe financial damage. Thus, the existing retrieved ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are highly applicable and fit the new Type 6 context, with the same severity, occurrence and detection ratings preserved."
O-ring and sealant/gasket aging and wear,"Coolant and oil leaks, contamination of fluids, loss of fluid pressure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase for sealing against leakage of gas mixture) closely matches several retrieved failure analysis entries from Gas Engine Type 4 within the Engine Block subsystem and Crankcase system element related to sealing degradation over time caused by O-ring and sealant/gasket aging. Although the exact product type differs (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effects are highly analogous, sharing similar preventive and detective measures. Minor product generation differences warrant slight conservative adjustments based on typical progression of gas engine designs. Severity ratings for failure effects involving coolant and oil leaks, contamination, and loss of pressure consistently rank between 5 and 7, reflecting moderate to customer-impacting process disturbances or reduced service. Occurrence ratings for aging-related failure causes remain around 3, considering similar preventive measures like design specifications, supplier involvement, and life alignment with maintenance. Detection ratings are consistently 4 due to effective leakage tests and endurance inspections, offering relatively high likelihood of detection before customer impact. Given close functional and engineering similarities, the documented ratings are adapted with clear alignment to target context without significant change."
Sealant and gasket design inadequacies,"Coolant and oil leakage, loss of pressure, fluid contamination","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase with failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' caused by 'Sealant and gasket design inadequacies' leading to leakage and contamination failure effects. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category, same subsystem and very close system element context) shows multiple records for 'Degradation of sealing over time' failure mode on crankcase-sealing related components with the same failure cause ('Sealant / Gasket design') and similar preventive/detective measures. Considering minor possible variations between Gas Engine Type 4 and Type 6, adaptation is done as follows: Severity is consistent with leakage and loss of pressure impacts rated 7 (reduced service, dissatisfied customers) per retrieved similar failure effect ratings (oil/coolant leak into environment, pressure loss all rated 7). Occurrence is rated 3 because extensive preventive measures (design per specs, supplier involvement, tolerance control, design life per maintenance schedule) are in place, matching similar retrieved occurrence ratings. Detection is rated 4 reflecting the presence of multiple effective detective measures (leakage test, endurance run with inspections, assembly and bench testing) which provide a High likelihood of detection in subsequent process stages but are not certain. This is consistent with the detection rating for 'Sealant / Gasket design' causes in the retrieved data. Hence, ratings align well from the similar context data and are slightly adapted for the target system by maintaining the same scale to reflect comparable risk profile in Gas Engine Types. The thoroughness of detective measures supports detection rating 4 rather than higher (less detectable)."
Incorrect assembly process or insufficient design for assembly,Blow-by gas leak to environment and damage to secondary components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target FMEA case concerns 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)' in the 'Crankcase' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved data includes multiple failure modes labeled 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' for the same system element and subsystem but in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. This represents the same product category and very close functional context, with only engine version differing. Preventive and detective measures are closely aligned ('Involve production team into design process', work instructions, torque procedures, various MCE testbench and endurance tests, leakage tests), indicating a direct strong correlation. Severity ratings for similar failure effects ('Blow-by gas leak to environment' and 'Damage to secondary components') are consistently rated at 5 in retrieved data, which reflects process and environmental impact but no regulatory violation or catastrophic financial loss. Occurrence ratings for failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' are consistently 5, reflecting an occasional occurrence despite preventive measures. Detection ratings vary slightly between 6 and 4 in retrieved cases depending on detective methods but mostly indicate detection primarily through extensive bench and assembly testing before delivery rather than early or certain detection. Given similarity in system element, failure mode, cause, failure effect, preventive and detective measures, we adopt retrieved ratings with slight adjustment consideration if target measures imply improved detection, but here they are very similar. Therefore, Severity = 5, Occurrence = 5, Detection = 6, consistent with retrieved data for the given cause and failure mode in similar engine product. This accounts for effective but not perfect assembly controls and detection mainly through testbench and assembly inspections prior to customer delivery."
Bolted joint design errors causing insufficient sealing,"Blow-by gas leak to environment, secondary damage","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with a failure mode of 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem's 'Crankcase' system element. Retrieved data shows very similar failure modes named 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem and same function (sealing the crankcase), with the failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and failure effect 'Blow-by gas leak to environment' plus 'Damage to secondary components'. Although there is a variation in the specific engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) and exact component naming (Crankcase vs Front end housing or Rear end cover), the functional context, system element identity, and failure cause/effect closely match, fitting the SIMILAR_CONTEXT category.

Severity: The retrieved severity rating for 'Blow-by gas leak to environment' and 'Damage to secondary components' is 5. This reflects moderate impact causing process disturbance or some customer problems but no regulatory violation or major financial damage. Considering the function is sealing the crankcase and the blow-by gas leak can cause secondary damage but no direct safety/regulation issues reported, the severity rating of 5 is consistent and appropriate.

Occurrence: The retrieved occurrence for 'Bolted joint design' as the failure cause in this failure mode is rated at 3 in some documents and 4 in others, with preventive measures similar to those listed (Design acc. spec, tolerances, bolt joint calculation, FEA). The target preventive measures are well aligned with those documented as effective preventive steps. Given these strong preventive measures and consistency, occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood) is appropriate, slightly conservative due to complexity, but reflecting good prevention.

Detection: The detection rating varies between 3 and 6 in retrieved similar cases. The target has extensive detective measures including MCE testbench overload/performance/start-stop tests, leakage and assembly tests, vibration measurement, preload measurements, endurance runs. The retrieved similar cases have detection rating around 6, meaning detection is possible by targeted inspection but not easily certain before customer delivery. Given the large battery of detective measures here, the detection rating can be assigned slightly better at 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) compared to the 6 in similar but less intensive environments.

Conclusion: Adopt severity = 5 as in similar retrieved cases; assign occurrence = 3 reflecting effective preventive measures; assign detection = 4 reflecting very comprehensive detection methods exceeding typical practices found in referenced cases. Ratings are consistent with failure cause, effect, and existing preventive/detective measures in the target context, adjusted conservatively for improved detection.

Crankcase design faults affecting sealing integrity,Environmental gas leakage and secondary component damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)' in 'Crankcase' of Gas Engine Type 6 closely aligns with several failure modes named 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)', 'Leakage of blow-by gas', and 'Gas mixture leakage' in the 'Crankcase' or related components in Gas Engine Type 4 within the same product category and subsystem context. The failure cause 'Crankcase design faults affecting sealing integrity' matches well with 'Crankcase design' failure causes listed in the retrieved data. Preventive and detective measures are very similar or identical, indicating comparable control effectiveness. Severity ratings in retrieved similar cases range from 4 (oil/blow-by gas environmental leakage) to 5 (blow-by gas leak to environment and damage to secondary components). The target failure effect is 'Environmental gas leakage and secondary component damage' which logically corresponds to a severity of 5, reflecting moderate environmental impact and equipment damage but no regulatory violation or catastrophic failure. Occurrence ratings for 'Crankcase design' related causes in these contexts are consistently 6, reflecting occasional to frequent occurrences despite existing preventive measures like O-ring specs, 1D oil circuit analysis, tolerance stack-up, and 3D clash checks. Detective ratings range from 4 to 5 considering daily functional testing and monitoring means exist but may not catch all issues prior to customer impact. Therefore, the retrieved ratings can be adapted but slightly adjusted to reflect the target product's higher type designation (6 vs 4), assuming a similar but possibly slightly improved detection. Summarized rating decisions: Severity = 5 (aligned with environmental leakage and secondary damage); Occurrence = 6 (occasional, consistent with preventive measure limitations); Detection = 4 (high likelihood detection by functional daily testing and monitoring)."
Front/end cover design deficiencies,"Blow-by gas environment leakage, damage to secondary components","EXACT MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)' on the 'Crankcase' system element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has a strongly matching retrieved context in 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same subsystem, system element (or closely related end/front cover), function, failure mode, and failure cause ('Front/end cover design'). The preventive and detective measures listed in the retrieved data closely align with the target system's measures, indicating similar maturity of design and test coverage. The failure effects 'Blow-by gas leak to environment' and 'Damage to secondary components' appear with severity rating 5 in the retrieved data, reflecting moderate process disturbance and customer impact, consistent with the definitions. Occurrence is rated at 3 due to quite robust preventive measures (design to spec, simulations, team involvement). Detection rating is higher at 6 since detection relies on targeted inspections (MCE testbench, leakage test, endurance runs, oil/coolant monitoring) and not on certain detection in subsequent processes. Given these matches and the alignment of preventive and detective measures, the risk ratings from the retrieved data apply directly without adjustment."
Inappropriate geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specification,Gas leakage and secondary damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 (newer or different model in the same product category - gas engines), with failure mode (Blow-by leakage or reverse flow) on the crankcase sealing function and cause being 'Inappropriate geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specification'. Retrieved data shows several highly similar failure modes for Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem 'Engine Block', with failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' or similar gas leakage modes involving crankcase sealing with the same failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'. Preventive and detection measures listed match closely with those for the target system (design-to-spec, tolerances stackup, leakage and assembly testing, MCE test benches). The severity rating for gas leakage and secondary damage is consistently rated as 5. The occurrence ratings for this cause with given preventive measures in Gas Engine Type 4 contexts are uniformly rated as 3 (low likelihood). Detection ratings with comparable test methods are 6 (detection only through targeted inspection). Gas Engine Type 6 might have incremental design or operational differences, but given identical failure mode, cause, effect, overlapping preventive/detective measures, and same product category, it is reasonable to adopt these ratings with minor confidence adjustments. Hence, we retain Severity=5, Occurrence=3, Detection=6 matching closest prior data, consistent with FMEA rating definitions and system similarity rules."
Lubrication system faults contributing to pressure or sealing issues,"Gas leak to environment, component damage","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)' in the 'Crankcase' as part of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares strong functional and system element identity with documented failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' specifically 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' and 'Leakage of blow-by gas'. Both involve sealing of the crankcase to prevent gas leakage, with similar failure causes related to lubrication system faults, bolted joint design, gasket and O-ring aging, and crankcase design. The preventive and detective measures in the target system closely match those in the retrieved examples, except the target is Type 6 gas engine vs Type 4 in data. Thus, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 context are a solid baseline but require slight adjustment: 1) Severity is adapted upward to reflect the explicit indication of environmental gas leak plus component damage (severity 5 in Gas Engine Type 4 data for blow-by leakage with environmental gas leak), but given the potential component damage, a severity rating of 6 is justified (just above 5) to represent moderate customer dissatisfaction and possible secondary damage. 2) Occurrence remains at 5 because preventive measures are comprehensive but failure due to assembly and lubrication faults is still moderately frequent (matches occurrence 5 in retrieved examples). 3) Detection is increased from 6 (Gas Engine Type 4) to 5 because the target system includes multiple continuous monitoring measures (pressure monitoring, vibration measurement, visual daily inspection, assembly checklists, endurance tests) that provide better detection opportunities than the Type 4 system described, which relies heavily on MCE testbench and endurance tests with limited immediate detection. Detection rating 5 meaning detection is mostly via targeted inspection is appropriate given these measures. This provides a consistent and technically sound risk rating adapted to the newer engine type and the detailed preventive/detective measures supplied in the target context."
Faulty assembly or lack of design for assembly,"Coolant leak into environment, loss of coolant pressure, coolant contamination of oil","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system ('Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase sealing against coolant leakage due to faulty assembly or lack of design for assembly) aligns closely with a retrieved failure mode 'Coolant leakage' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4', engine block subsystem, sealing the crankcase, with the failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly'. Both systems are gas engines in the same product category, same subsystem category (Engine Block), same system element function (sealing for coolant), identical failure mode (coolant leakage), identical failure cause (poor assembly/design for assembly), and similar failure effects (coolant leak to environment, loss of pressure, coolant contamination of oil). Preventive and detective measures are essentially equivalent and comprehensive in both contexts. The retrieved ratings are Severity 5 (moderate impact - process disturbance for some customers), Occurrence 5 (occasional occurrence considering current preventive controls), and Detection 6 (requires targeted inspection to detect prior to customer delivery). These ratings fit well for the target context since the coolant leakage leads to moderate system disruption but not safety or regulatory violation, multiple preventive design and assembly controls exist but occasional failures can occur, and detection relies on specific leak and performance testing. Hence, the retrieved ratings are applicable with no adjustment."
Crankcase and front/end cover design issues,"Coolant leakage, pressure loss and contamination","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Coolant leakage' due to 'Crankcase and front/end cover design issues' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to multiple retrieved failure modes from 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block', specifically 'Coolant leakage', 'Coolant leakage (pressure drop)', and 'Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)' in the crankcase or front/end housing components. These failure modes affect the same function ('Sealing against leakages coolant' or similar sealing functions) and have failure causes that include design issues on the crankcase and cover elements. The product category and subsystem context (gas engine, engine block, crankcase sealing) are consistent although the engine type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4). Preventive and detective measures are very similar or more comprehensive (Type 6 includes multi-body simulation, FEA, and extensive testbenches). Severity ratings in the retrieved data for related coolant leakage failure effects involving pressure loss, coolant contamination, and leakage range mostly at severity 5, corresponding to process/customer impact such as coolant pressure loss and contamination. Occurrence ratings for design-related causes in crankcase and covers vary between 3-4 (occasional likelihood) considering strong preventive measures like FEA, tolerance controls, and design to spec. Detection ratings for these causes are between 4-6 reflecting moderate detection capabilities by leakage testing, assembly testing, endurance runs, and coolant system monitoring. Given the similarity but acknowledging potentially improved measures and newer product type, severity is kept consistent at 5, occurrence conservatively placed at 3 (low-occurrence due to strong preventive design) rather than higher 4 from Type 4, and detection rated at 5 reflecting detection mainly by targeted inspection and testbench methods rather than certain or high-likelihood detection. This adjustment considers the robustness of existing preventive and detective measures in the target context while adhering to consistency in severity and reasoning for occurrence and detection adjustments."
Assembly defects and inadequate design for assembly,Oil leak to environment and loss of oil pressure causing lubrication failure risks,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Oil leakage' on the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, with failure cause 'Assembly defects and inadequate design for assembly' and failure effect 'Oil leak to environment and loss of oil pressure causing lubrication failure risks' closely matches multiple retrieved failure modes and causes related to 'Oil leakage', 'Oil leakage over time', and 'Oil leakage' on crankcase or engine block components in the 'Gas Engine Type 4'. These have consistent preventive and detective measures, particularly on assembly process and design for assembly aspects, including involvement of production, control, and service teams, tightening torques, assembly instructions, and various functional and leakage tests. The severity of oil leakage causing environmental leak and loss of oil pressure with lubrication risk aligns with a Severity rating of 7, as seen in similar 'Oil leakage' where oil leak to environment and loss of oil pressure are rated severity 7. Occurrence ratings for assembly-related causes in the similar context are generally at 5, reflecting occasional failure likelihood despite preventive measures such as work instructions and team involvement. Detection ratings for assembly-related causes are mostly 6, indicating detection through targeted inspections like leakage tests, endurance runs, functional tests, and assembly tests but not guaranteed before delivery. The gas engine type 6 is a close variant to type 4 within the same product category and subsystem context, so the ratings are adapted slightly but kept consistent with the effective preventive and detective measures in place. Therefore, Severity is set at 7, Occurrence at 5, and Detection at 6."
Crankcase design shortcomings and gasket/O-ring aging,"Oil environmental contamination, loss of oil pressure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase cause of oil leakage due to crankcase design shortcomings and gasket/O-ring aging, impacting sealing against gas mixture leakage with failure effect of environmental oil contamination and oil pressure loss. Retrieved data has multiple closely related failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' crankcase under the 'Engine Block' subsystem with similar failure causes (crankcase design and O-ring aging) causing oil leakage. Although the exact product variant differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), the system element (crankcase), function (sealing against oil/gas leakage), failure mode (oil leakage), failure causes, and failure effects are aligned and within the same product category and functional context, qualifying as SIMILAR_CONTEXT. 

Severity: Retrieved severity ratings for oil leakage causing environmental contamination are 7 (e.g., ""Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase"" failure mode) for environmental contamination, and 7 for oil pressure loss consequences. The target failure effect involves both environmental contamination and oil pressure loss, which are clearly more than moderate disturbances but below regulatory violation or catastrophic failure. Thus, a severity rating of 7 is consistent with retrieved references for similar effects in crankcases.

Occurrence: For failure cause 'Crankcase design', occurrence ratings in retrieved data range mainly around 3 to 6 depending on the exact failure mode and preventive measures. More critical cases (e.g., excess oil concentration) show up to 6 due to complexity and design challenges. Preventive measures in target system are strong and detailed (O-Ring specifications, tightening specs, oil circuit analysis, tolerance stack-ups, modal checks, supplier recommendations), consistent with a partial control but not complete elimination. O-ring aging typically has occurrence ratings 2 to 3.
Considering the preventive measures listed in target, occurrence is best represented around 3 (low likelihood to occasional) given the effectiveness of listed design and maintenance standards, but acknowledging some aging effects.

Detection: For failure cause 'Crankcase design' and 'O-ring aging', detection ratings in retrieved data are mostly 4 to 5: MCE functional testing including daily leakage inspections, oil pressure monitoring, O-ring inspections, endurance runs, and field validations. These are timely and relatively good detective measures before customer delivery but rely on functional testing and periodic inspections, not immediate 100% certain detection.
Detection rating 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent or testing processes) or 5 (detection via targeted inspections) both fit well; given the mix of daily functional tests and endurance runs, rating 4 is justified to reflect good detection capability.

Summary: Using SIMILAR_CONTEXT adaptation,
- Severity: 7 (serious impact on environment and system function)
- Occurrence: 3 (low to occasional likelihood due to comprehensive preventive measures)
- Detection: 4 (high likelihood of detection in existing testing regimes)
These ratings also comply with the given rating definitions and internal consistency.

"Crankcase structural design deviations, improper assembly tolerances, geometry tolerance stack-up errors","Collision with crank train or power unit causing component damage, increased wear, or failure; improper cooling of piston leading to overheating and piston seizure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because there is a failure mode 'Misalignment of PCJ and crankcase' in the retrieved data with identical failure mode, cause, and effect but from a different product generation (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6). Both belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem (Engine Block). Preventive and detective measures are similar though some measures like 'assembly trials' and 'endurance runs' apply similarly. Therefore, retrieved ratings are adapted considering possible improvements in preventive/detective measures in Type 6 (assumed current system). Severity is consistent due to identical failure effects; Occurrence is considered slightly lower (5 to 4) due to improved preventive measures (detailed tolerance specs, MBS/FEA validations, early involvement of assembly). Detection remains at 4 considering extensive assembly and endurance testing. Hence, Severity=8, Occurrence=4, Detection=4."
"Aging, hardening or degradation of O-ring or sealing elements; improper sealing design or material selection; thermal cycling and vibration induced seal wear",Loss of oil pressure and reduced oil flow in PCJ lubrication circuit causing lubrication failure; environmental contamination with engine oil leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Oil leakage through crankcase-PCJ interface over time' closely matches failure modes retrieved involving crankcase sealing degradation and oil leakage in Gas Engines Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, and function related to sealing and oil flow (e.g., 'Degradation of sealing over time', 'Oil leakage over time', 'Leakage crankcase (outside)', 'Leakage crankcase (outside) over time'). The failure causes align well: aging/hardening of O-ring, improper sealing design/material, and thermal/vibration wear, supported by a variety of preventive and detective measures that overlap significantly with those described. Despite system evolution (Type 4 to Type 6), the fundamental sealing and oil leakage mechanisms and effects at the crankcase-PCJ interface remain similar in context and consequence within the same product category and subsystem context. Severity from retrieved data for oil leakage causing lubrication failure and environmental contamination is consistently rated 7 (reduced service/dissatisfied customers due to loss of oil pressure and leakage consequences), matching the impact of loss of oil pressure and environmental contamination caused by the specified failure effect. Occurrence ratings for O-ring aging and sealing degradation causes are mostly around 2-3 given strong preventive design involvement with suppliers and specification adherence. Detection ratings cluster between 4 and 5 due to multiple leakage tests, endurance runs, and functional inspections, which detect failures before customer impact but require targeted inspections or assembly tests–aligned with the detective measures in the target system. Rating adaptation: Severity retained at 7 (consistent effect severity), Occurrence set at 3 reflecting strong preventive design but residual risk over lifetime aging and material degradation, Detection rated 5 reflecting detection through targeted tests (leakage, endurance runs) but not certain in-process detection. This ensures consistency with the rating scale definitions, aligns with comparable failure modes in the retrieved RAG data, and reflects the detailed preventive/detective measures described in the target system context."
Design for assembly deficiencies; difficult tolerance specifications; inadequate consideration of maintenance and replacement access; sensor placement conflicts,Increased service effort and duration; potential damage of interface components including sensors during assembly or maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Poor serviceability of crankcase-PCJ interface' in the 'Crankcase' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches multiple failure mode records for 'Poor serviceability' in 'Crankcase' and similar Engine Block components from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both product families are similar (gas engine types), the subsystem and system element match, and the failure effects involve increased service effort and potential damage to interface components including sensors. The preventive and detective measures listed in the retrieved data overlap strongly with those of the target (e.g., design involvement, FEA, tolerance stack-up, assembly instructions, RAIP, sensor specification, assembly trials, MCE testing, vibration measurement, FPQ inspections). The retrieved severity ratings for effects involving increased service effort and interface damage for 'Poor serviceability' within the crankcase context vary between 2 and 5 depending on exact effect description, while occurrence ratings for design-for-assembly related causes hover around 5 and detection ratings range about 4–5. Given the target failure effect indicates 'Increased service effort and duration' plus 'potential damage to interface components including sensors' on crankcase-PCJ interface, a severity rating around 5 is justified (moderate process disturbance and maintenance difficulty, possible component damage). Occurrence should be rated consistent with 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' failure causes with similar preventive measures: 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting residual risk despite involvement of multidisciplinary teams and FEA simulations. Detection rating aligns with available assembly trials, commissioning checklists, system functional tests, and endurance validations, supporting a detection rating approximately 4 (high likelihood of detection before customer delivery). The ratings reflect adaptation from Gas Engine Type 4 to Type 6 — system complexity and preventive measures are consistent, but upgraded engine type and potentially increased service complexity warrant maintaining these robust but cautious ratings."
Inadequate bolted joint design; insufficient crankcase wall thickness; incorrect geometry tolerances; poor design of front/end cover or mating structures,Excessive movement or lack of stiffness resulting in loosening of bolted joints; damage of interface components; loss of positioning accuracy,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The analyzed failure mode 'Insufficient structural support in crankcase for PCJ interface' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase is highly similar to the documented 'Insufficient structural support' failure mode in the 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (engine block), system element identity (crankcase-related structural interfaces), and share the same failure effect characteristics: excessive movement, loosening bolts, damage to interface components, and loss of positioning accuracy. The failure causes (bolted joint design, crankcase design, geometry tolerances, etc.) and preventive measures (design per specification, FEA, bolt joint calculations, MBS, tolerances stack-up) are also highly comparable. Detective measures are similar, including leakage tests, assembly tests, bolted joint preload measurement, and endurance testing. Hence, the retrieved ratings are applicable but should be adapted considering the PCJ interface may have slightly higher precision requirements or criticality compared to flywheel side interfaces in Type 4 engines, justifying severity of 8 consistent with retrieved data. Occurrence ratings for these causes are consistently set at 3 (low likelihood) reflecting effective preventive measures. Detection ratings vary between 3-4 based on detection method effectiveness but tend to cluster around 3-4 due to effective targeted and functional testing available. Given similar preventive and detective controls and failure causes, the ratings for Type 6 crankcase PCJ interface are adopted with minor reasoning adjustments to reflect no significant change in risk posture. Severity is set at 8 due to potential customer dissatisfaction and damage to interface components. Occurrence at 3 due to robust preventive design and analysis measures. Detection at 3 considering targeted inspections and functional tests like preload measurement and testbench testing. This results in a consistent, justified risk rating set aligned to the similar context data."
Assembly process errors causing imbalance; bolted joint preload errors; crankcase design flaws; transient engine operations like start-up and cooldown inducing resonance,Fatigue related damage to interface components; loosening of bolted joints and sensors; noise quality issues; sensor failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase interface with failure mode 'Excessive vibration at crankcase-PCJ interface' causing fatigue damage, loosening joints/sensors, noise issues, and sensor failure. Retrieved data shows a very similar failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in the crankcase or front end housing of Gas Engine Type 4 with matching failure effects (fatigue damage on interfaces, loosening of bolted joints, noise issues, sensor failure) and similar failure causes, including assembly errors, bolted joint design, crankcase design, and transient engine operations. Preventive and detective measures are also closely aligned (design/specification adherence, simulations, joint preload calculations, assembly and endurance tests, vibration measurement, bolted joint preload monitoring). Given the same product category (Gas engine), subsystem, and essentially same system element context (crankcase interface vibration), the failure effects and failure causes overlap strongly. However, Gas Engine Type 6 is a newer/different engine variant possibly with different operating conditions and robustness margin, so minor contextual adjustments are needed. Severity is consistent with retrieved ratings of 7 for fatigue and loosening effects and 4 for sensor failure (the latter is a secondary effect). Occurrence rates are slightly adjusted downward from a general 5 (occasional) to 4 due to extensive cross-disciplinary involvement in design and preventive measures, meaning these errors are less frequent but still possible. Detection rating is set at 6 considering that detection requires multiple testbench and endurance runs with inspection and vibration measurements, aligned with retrieved data detection ratings (mostly 6). This rating reflects detection by highly targeted tests rather than early or certain detection. Overall, the SIMILAR_CONTEXT approach with careful minor rating adjustment is justified."
Inadequate design for vibration damping; improper assembly; crankcase or CCV system design flaws; lack of maintenance of oil or filter condition affecting system damping,Sensor failure due to overstress; erroneous sensor data leading to faulty control or diagnostics,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context involves 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification limits' on the system element 'Crankcase' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data most relevant is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' on similar subsystem and system element context with identical failure mode 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification' and the same failure effect 'Sensor failure'. Although the exact product version differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), and the system element naming matches exactly (Crankcase), the application context and preventive/detective measures are highly comparable. Therefore, ratings from the retrieved data are adapted with consideration for slightly improved maturity for Type 6 but maintaining the consistency of preventive/detective measures and impact severity. Severity is taken consistent with the retrieved failure effect severity of 4 (sensor failure with impact of faulty sensor readings causing control or diagnostic errors). Occurrence ratings from retrieved data range between 2 to 5 depending on failure cause; considering multiple causes in target context, occurrence is adapted conservatively as 4 (occasional) reflecting the presence of multiple validated preventive measures but also varied potential causes including assembly and design flaws and maintenance levels. Detection ratings in the retrieved data mostly range from 2 to 5 based on detective measures involving vibration tests, functional testing, and field validations – reflecting relatively good ability to detect but not guaranteed detection before customer impact. Detection is rated conservatively as 4 (high likelihood of detection) reflecting comprehensive test and monitoring coverage in preventive and detective measures. Overall, this yields consistent, justifiable adapted risk ratings for the target context."
Crankcase structural design,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, function 'Provides installation space for sensors') has an exact functional and failure mode/cause/effect match with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category, same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect). Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical. However, the target is a newer or different engine type variant. Given similarity of design principles and measures, the existing ratings from Type 4 are highly applicable, but considering possible increased complexity or service criticality in Type 6, the Severity remains the same (3: Insignificant disturbance) as the failure effect is not safety critical but affects sensor function slightly. Occurrence is 5 reflecting occasional occurrence with the same preventive measures in place. Detection remains at 5 meaning detection only through targeted inspection (assembly trials, endurance runs, field validation). Slight contextual uncertainty due to engine type upgrade is compensated by the stable and comprehensive preventive and detection controls. Thus, ratings are retained with analytical justification."
Assembly process / Design for assembly deficiencies,Increased service effort,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', crankcase in the engine block subsystem, function to 'Provide installation space for sensors', failure mode 'Poor serviceability', and failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly deficiencies'. Retrieved data shows very similar failure mode, cause, effect, subsystem, and system element in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical preventive and detective measures. The contexts are from the same product category (gas engines), same subsystem (engine block), same system element (crankcase), same function, failure mode, and failure cause with close preventive and detective controls. Minor variation in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) suggests no significant change in operating conditions or customer impact for this failure mode. Severity rating for 'Increased service effort' in the retrieved data is 5 (process disturbance, problems for some customers). However, other retrieved data for the exact failure effect phrase 'Increased service effort' in front end housing subsystem shows severity of 2 (insignificant, slight disturbance). Given that crankcase serviceability is generally more impactful than just front housing, but less critical than safety-related failures, rating severity at 5 as per the most similar context is justified. Occurrence rating is 5, indicating occasional failure cause occurrence despite existing preventive measures like FPQ, model & drawing checks, and assembly instructions, consistent with complexity of assembly process deficiencies. Detection rating is 4, indicating a high likelihood of detection through measures listed (Assembly Trial, Commissioning Checklist, MCE Functional Testing). Considering the similar measures and their effectiveness, these detection ratings hold. Therefore, retrieved risk ratings (S=5, O=5, D=4) for the similar failure mode, cause, and failure effect are adapted directly to the target context with justification based on similarity and preventive/detective measure equivalence."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification in crankcase,"Damage during service (e.g. interface components, sensors)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Poor serviceability' caused by 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' in the 'Crankcase' of a Gas Engine Type 6 has strong similarity to retrieved data for 'Poor serviceability' with the same cause and subsystem element in Gas Engine Type 4. Both are within the same product category (gas engine), subsystem (Engine Block), and system element identity (Crankcase). The function 'Provides installation space for sensors' and failure effect 'Damage during service (e.g. interface components, sensors)' corresponds closely to the retrieved failure mode in the Crankcase with similar function and failure effect, which has severity rating 2. Preventive measures ('Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'Tolerances stackup') and detective measures (leakage test, assembly test, multiple MCE testbench tests) are consistent in both contexts. Minor product generation differences (Type 4 vs Type 6) do not materially affect the failure cause likelihood or detection capability. Hence, occurrence and detection ratings from retrieved data (Occurrence=3, Detection=4) are applicable with strong confidence. Severity is adapted slightly upward from 2 (from existing similar failure effect) to 3 due to possible higher impact damage during service as described, while still low impact on customer/service as per definition. This preserves rating consistency across similar failure effects."
Crankcase structural design not adequately dampening vibrations,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, with failure mode 'Vibration is too high' caused by 'Crankcase structural design not adequately dampening vibrations', leading to 'Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip'. Retrieved data closely matches a failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component of the 'Engine Block' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', impacting the 'Provides installation space for sensors' function. Preventive and detective measures are very similar, including usage of FEA, MBS, 1D simulation, sensor specification, detailed vibration testing, and endurance runs. The severity for sensor failure is consistently rated 4 in the retrieved context, as faulty sensors cause reduced customer satisfaction but not regulatory violations or major damage. Occurrence rating of 3 is assigned for the crankcase design cause given the advanced preventive measures are effective but some residual risk exists. Detection rating of 6 corresponds to the extensive testbench and inspection methods which provide moderate detection capability prior to customer delivery. Adjustments consider that Type 6 gas engine may have more stringent sensor reliability requirements but similar design and testing methods apply, so ratings from Type 4 context are adapted with reasoning but left unchanged. Thus, Severity=4, Occurrence=3, Detection=6 is most appropriate consistent with existing data and measures for this similar context."
Crankcase structural design,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is Gas Engine Type 6, while retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4; both belong to the same product category (Gas Engine). The subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (providing installation space for cable routing), failure mode (Poor serviceability), failure cause (Crankcase structural design), and failure effect (faulty sensor function leading to engine trip) match closely. Preventive and detective measures are identical or very similar, suggesting similar risk conditions. Slight adaptation is done considering potential incremental improvements in Gas Engine Type 6 over Type 4, but no significant changes in design or detection capability are implied. Severity rating has been increased from 3 to 7 due to the noted failure effect of 'faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip', which corresponds to reduced service and customer dissatisfaction, not just slight disturbance. Occurrence and detection ratings are retained consistent with retrieved data due to unchanged preventive and detective measures effectiveness."
Sensor specification,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data contains an almost exact match on failure mode ('Poor serviceability'), failure cause ('Sensor specification'), failure effect ('Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip'), and subsystem ('Engine Block') for a Gas Engine Type 4. The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, same product category (gas engine), same subsystem and system element (Crankcase), and the function ('Provides installation space for cable routing') closely matches an existing function from the retrieved data ('Provides installation space for cable routing'). Preventive measures and detective measures are almost identical (with one additional preventive measure 'Involve service team into design process' in the target, which is consistent with the retrieved context). This qualifies as SIMILAR_CONTEXT rather than EXACT_MATCH because the product variant differs (Type 6 vs Type 4) and might have slight differences in engine criticality or design maturity. Severity of 3 in the retrieved data corresponds to 'Insignificant; customer only slightly disturbed' but the failure effect here is 'Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip', suggesting potential engine shutdown and higher criticality. Given this, severity should be elevated because a trip is a significant event. Considering severity rating scale, an engine trip is likely customer noticeable with service impact, thus severity 7 (Reduced service, customers dissatisfied) is appropriate. Occurrence is rated 2 (Unlikely) in retrieved data due to good preventive measures. Given the additional preventive measure added (involve service team), occurrence may remain 2. Detection is rated 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) which aligns with existing 'Assembly test' detective measure - so detection rating 4 is suitable. Overall, adjusted risk ratings reflect the higher customer impact of engine trip (severity increased from 3 to 7), while occurrence and detection ratings are consistent to prevent nuisance risks."
Crankcase structural design,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase shares the same system element, function (provides installation space for cable routing), failure mode ('Lack of structure for support'), failure cause ('Crankcase structural design'), and failure effect ('Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip') as the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Despite the different engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6), both are within the same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), and system element (Crankcase), making the context closely analogous. Preventive and detective measures in the target system are more comprehensive and slightly expanded compared to the retrieved data (e.g., additional measures like 'Assembly test', 'Leakage test', 'MCE testbench' tests), indicating potentially better control and detection capability. The failure effect severity relates to sensor malfunction leading to engine trip—a critical operational impact but no direct regulatory or major financial violation noted. The previous severity rating of 3 ('Insignificant, customer only slightly disturbed') seems low given 'engine trip' can cause customer dissatisfaction and service impact. However, no retrieved data indicates higher severity for this effect, and the failure only results in trip (likely safe shutdown), not catastrophic damage. We keep severity at 3 for consistency with the retrieved rating. Occurrence in the retrieved data is 5 (occasional occurrence) with established preventive measures. Given the target system includes several additional preventive steps (FEA, MBS, CAD checks, ISO vibration tests) plus multiple assembly and endurance checks, occurrence might be slightly lower due to better control, but since structural design is fundamental and still subject to design variability, occurrence remains close to occasional (5). Detection was rated 5 previously (detection only through targeted inspection). The target system's added extensive testing and functional test benches suggest improved detection capability, but the failure is still likely only detected through targeted inspections and test benches rather than automatic inline detection. Detection is thus maintained at 5. In summary, ratings are adapted from retrieved data with slight consideration for potentially improved measures. Severity is moderate (3), occurrence remains occasional (5) given complex structural design challenges, and detection is moderately difficult (5)."
Sensor specification,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 while retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4; subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provides installation space for cable routing), failure mode (Lack of structure for support), failure cause (Sensor specification), and failure effect (Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip) all match. Preventive and detective measures in the target system are more extensive than those in the retrieved data. Severity remains consistent as failure effect impact to customer/system level is the same. Occurrence is adjusted slightly higher due to more complex sensor specs and newer engine type, but existing preventive measures appear robust, so only a moderate increase is justified. Detection rating remains similar given similar or slightly improved detection methods. Ratings are consistent and justified based on the difference in engine type but strong measure overlap."
Crankcase structural design,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: There is an exact match for the failure mode, cause, and effects in a very similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category, same subsystem, same system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause). The preventive and detective measures are also identical. The main difference is the Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4. Both are gas engines with likely very similar design philosophy and operational conditions. Given the matching preventive and detective measures, severity and risk ratings mostly hold, but slight adaptation is considered given possible differences in sensitivity or system robustness in the newer Type 6. The retrieved severity of 3 (insignificant disturbance) seems slightly low considering the failure effect is 'Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip' which implies a customer-visible functional impact and engine trip consequence. The engine trip is a significant customer dissatisfaction and potential operational interruption (severity zone 7-8). However, the retrieved data rated severity 3, possibly because the sensor fault is only an initial effect with the trip as a secondary consequence. Considering typical severity rating guidelines, engine trip usually rates 7-8 due to customer impact and machine stoppage. Occurrence rating 5 (occasional) aligns with the complex design-related cause with existing preventive measures that partly reduce occurrence. Detection rating 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) is consistent given the detective measures are endurance and field validation, which identifies faults but not immediately during production. Therefore, the severity rating will be adjusted upward slightly to 7, reflecting customer dissatisfaction and operational disruption (engine trip). Occurrence and detection ratings from retrieved data will be adopted as they fit the preventive and detective measures well. Final ratings: Severity 7, Occurrence 5, Detection 5."
Sensor specification,Faulty sensor function can lead to engine trip,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match in subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (providing installation space for cable routing), failure mode (cable breakage to initial support), failure cause (sensor specification), and failure effect (faulty sensor function leading to engine trip) in Gas Engine Type 4. Preventive and detective measures are identical. The main difference is the product variant (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product category (gas engines) and same functional context. Given high similarity and comparable operational conditions, the severity remains consistent at 3 (customer slightly disturbed but no regulation violation, as a sensor fault triggers an engine trip, creating noticeable disturbance but not catastrophic damage). Occurrence is maintained at 2 (unlikely) as preventive measures—supplier recommendations, CAD model checks, and vibration design values—are effective and identical. Detection remains 4 indicating a high likelihood of detection by assembly test before delivery, consistent with measures. Minor differences in engine variant are unlikely to materially affect these ratings due to equal preventive and detective controls and similar failure impact. Therefore, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 apply directly with no adjustment needed."
Design flaws in front housing geometry leading to insufficient stiffness or load-bearing capacity,"Excessive deformation or displacement of front housing under engine loads, leading to misalignment of connected components","SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target failure mode 'Loss of structural support' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches closely with 'Insufficient structural support' failure mode reported for 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' within 'Engine Block' subsystem. Both relate to front housing providing structural support and stiffness. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar, including design involvement teams, FEA, MBS, tolerances, CAD checks and extensive testbench and endurance tests. Severity ratings for failure effects related to excessive deformation, lack of stiffness, and damage to interface parts are consistently rated 8 in retrieved data, appropriate for misalignment of connected components causing functional impairment and customer dissatisfaction. Occurrence ratings in the retrieved context range around 3 (low likelihood) for design issues given solid preventive controls. Detection ratings are mostly 4 (high likelihood of detection) reflecting multiple testbench and inspection activities prior to delivery. Considering the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 (likely similar operational conditions and customer impact), the retrieved ratings can be applied directly or with very minor adjustment. Therefore, Severity = 8, Occurrence = 3, Detection = 4 fits well in the rating framework given equivalent failure causes and controls."
"Crack initiation from fatigue due to vibration and transient engine operation (start-up, cool-down thermal stresses)",Crack propagation leading to partial or complete structural failure of the end cover/front housing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target system context is a 'Gas Engine Type 6', Engine Block subsystem, specifically the 'End cover / Front housing' providing mechanical support, with failure mode 'Structural support fails' caused by 'Crack initiation from fatigue due to vibration and transient engine operation (start-up, cool-down thermal stresses)', causing crack propagation leading to partial or complete structural failure. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' systems in the Engine Block subsystem include very similar failure modes (e.g., 'Structural support fails', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high') in related components such as front end housing, CCV system, and crankcase, with failure causes including transient engine operation and vibration effects. Preventive and detective measures listed are closely aligned and similar in scope and technical nature (FEA simulations, modal analysis, vibration and pressure monitoring, endurance runs, functional testing). Severity for equivalent failure effects ('structural failure', 'damage on components', 'lack of stiffness') consistently range between 7 to 8, indicating high customer/system impact due to structural failure. Occurrence for similar vibration and transient operation causes is typically rated 5 considering existing preventive measures like FEA and modal analysis. Detection ratings vary from 2 to 4 for these causes, reflecting good vibration and pressure monitoring systems with field validation and functional testing in place. Given the usage in Gas Engine Type 4 with analogous failure modes and causes, and similar preventive/detective measures, the ratings can be adapted with reasoning: The severity aligns at 8, reflecting serious structural failure with potential operational impact. Occurrence is rated at 5, due to the fatigue crack initiation under transient loads despite preventive measures. Detection is assigned 3, indicating high likelihood of early detection through existing vibration measurement, endurance runs, and pressure monitoring combined with field validation, better than the worst cases but not certain detection before customer impact. This balanced adaptation accounts for slightly newer engine type possibly having similar but slightly improved detection due to advanced measures."
Insufficient design consideration for cable and sensor installation space in front housing,"Obstruction or damage to cables and sensors, resulting in sensor failure or excessive service effort","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Unintended function – Misalignment of cable routing' in the End cover / Front housing of Gas Engine Type 6 is closely similar to the retrieved failure mode 'Poor serviceability' due to 'Front/End cover design' causing increased service effort and damage to cables/sensors in Gas Engine Type 4's Front end housing (damper housing). Both pertain to installation space and structural design issues affecting cables/sensors, within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (engine block). Preventive and detective measures are highly aligned (design teams involved, specification adherence, FEA, simulation, extensive testing). Minor product generation difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) suggests negligible change in likelihood and detection capabilities but a slight increase in severity reflecting possible increased complexity or customer impact in Type 6. Therefore, severity is adapted slightly upwards from 2 to 3 (reflecting process disturbance beyond slight disturbance), occurrence kept consistent at 3 (low likelihood with robust preventive measures), detection consistent at 4 (high likelihood of detection via various bench and assembly tests)."
Design not accounting for ease of maintenance and accessibility of front housing fasteners and seals,"Increased service time, higher risk of assembly errors, and potential damage during maintenance activities","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Poor serviceability' on the 'End cover / Front housing' (front housing element) in 'Gas Engine Type 6' strongly aligns with retrieved data for 'Poor serviceability' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' on 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same 'Engine Block' subsystem and same system element identity (front housing/end cover equivalent). The failure effect corresponds to increased service time, risk of assembly errors and damage during maintenance activities, matching the retrieved failure effects 'Increased service effort' and 'Damage during service' (severity 2). The preventive measures listed match closely with the retrieved context's preventive measures for 'Front/End cover design' failure cause, which has an occurrence of 3 and detection of 4. Given the similarity in product category, subsystem, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and measures, the retrieved ratings for occurrence (3) and detection (4) are relevant. 

However, the target effect phrase implies potentially higher impact on service reliability and risk of errors, which may be slightly more critical than the retrieved severity of 2 (minimal disturbance). Because the target mentions 'increase of risk of assembly errors and potential damage during maintenance activities' and 'higher service time', which may inconvenience the customer significantly, I rate severity slightly higher to 3 (customer slightly disturbed). Occurrence and detection reflect effective preventive and detection measures in place, keeping them aligned with retrieved values.

Hence, adjusted ratings are: Severity 3 (slight disturbance/impact), Occurrence 3 (low likelihood with preventive design involvement), Detection 4 (high likelihood of detection in testbench and assembly steps)."
Incorrect geometry or surface finish on sealing surfaces of front housing,Oil or coolant leakage impacting engine operation and environmental compliance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the 'Front housing (end cover)' element, failure mode 'Loss of sealing interface integrity' and failure cause 'Incorrect geometry or surface finish on sealing surfaces' is highly analogous to retrieved failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' engine block subsystem, specifically sealing-related leaks due to geometry/tolerance issues on sealing faces (e.g., 'Coolant leaks to through CH-liner interface over time', 'Blow-by leakage', 'Coolant leakage', 'Degradation of sealing over time'). The key differences are minor product generation differences (Type 6 vs. Type 4 engines) and nominally the exact front housing, but both share the same subsystem and similar functional sealing interface requirements. Preventive and detective measures are closely aligned in scope and depth (drawing/tolerance/specification compliance, FEA simulations, extensive testing incl. leakage and assembly tests, endurance runs, field validation). Thus, ratings from similar contexts can be adapted with reasoning: 

Severity: Retrieved severity ratings for leaks causing oil/coolant/environmental contamination range 4-7, depending on effect severity. The failure effect specified here includes environmental compliance impacts and operational leakage, which justifies a severity rating around 7 (customers dissatisfied due to reduced engine service life, possible environmental regulation violation potential, but not immediate engine destruction).

Occurrence: Geometry or surface finish failures in previous contexts show occurrence ratings around 3 (low likelihood) due to strong preventive measures including specification adherence, FEA, and 3D model analysis. Given the preventive measures are detailed and comparable, we assign an occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood).

Detection: Detective measures listed (leakage test, assembly test, multiple functional and endurance tests, field validation) indicate high likelihood of detection before customer shipment, but not certain detection in every case. Analogous failure causes have detection ratings in the range 4 to 6. Because multiple intensive tests including leakage and endurance runs are used, detection probability is relatively high. We assign a detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes).

Summary: The similarity is strong enough that direct exact match ratings do not exist, but adaptation with reasoning based on very close similar failure modes and causes is appropriate. Ratings reflect a sealing failure mode impacting oil/coolant leakage with robust prevention and detection measures in place."
O-Ring aging and material degradation,Coolant leak into oil and environment causing loss of coolant pressure and potential engine overheating,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode 'Loss of sealing function leading to coolant leakage' caused by 'O-Ring aging and material degradation' in the 'End cover / Front housing' element within 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is very similar to multiple failure modes and causes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' for engine block front end housing or related covers. The failure mode relates closely to 'Degradation of sealing over time' and 'Coolant leakage' failure modes caused by 'O-Ring aging' or 'O-ring design' in the retrieved data. The preventive measures (design per specification, tolerance control, supplier involvement, design life per maintenance schedule) and detective measures (leakage tests, endurance run inspection, assembly and functional test benches) closely align with those in the retrieved context, indicating similar effectiveness. However, slight context differences might exist due to 'Gas Engine Type 6' possibly involving different severity impacts caused by coolant leaking into oil and environment with subsequent engine overheating potential, which can increase impact severity slightly over the retrieved Type 4 data. Therefore, severity is adjusted slightly higher within documented ranges. Occurrence and detection are consistent with retrieved data for similar causes and measures, reflecting stable preventive and detective capabilities. Severity rating is set moderately high due to coolant leak potentially leading to engine overheating and environmental loss. Occurrence rating is moderate (3) consistent with 'O-Ring aging' occurrences after design, supplier and maintenance actions. Detection rating is moderate (4) reflecting detection via leakage and endurance tests before customer impact. This balanced view applies analytical reasoning adapting Type 4 ratings to the new product context."
Bolted joint loosening due to vibration and improper preload,Oil leakage to environment and reduced oil pressure causing lubrication failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode ('Loss of sealing function leading to oil leakage' due to 'Bolted joint loosening due to vibration and improper preload' on 'End cover / Front housing' sealing the engine block) shows close similarity to multiple retrieved failure modes related to oil leakage caused by bolted joint issues in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4, such as 'Oil leakage over time', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Degradation of sealing over time', and specifically failure causes identified as 'Bolted joint design' or 'Bolt loosening from vibration'. Although the exact product version (Type 6 vs Type 4) and exact system element differ (End cover/front housing vs crankcase/v-room/rear end cover), the functional context (sealing leading to oil leakage), failure cause (bolted joint loosening/vibration/improper preload), preventive and detective measures are highly comparable, and the severity of oil leakage effects and lubrication loss are analogous. Based on existing consistent preventive measures (FEA simulation, bolted joint calculations, ultrasonic bolt measurement, assembly instructions, tightening torques) and detective measures (validation plans, ultrasonic bolt measurements, vibration surveys, functional testing), the retrieved occurrence ratings for similar bolt loosening causes range from 3 to 5, and detection ratings range from 2 to 5 depending on inspection thoroughness. Severity ratings vary between 7 (loss of oil pressure and lubrication failure) and 9-10 (oil leakage to environment with regulatory impact). 

Given the target failure effect includes oil leakage to environment and lubrication failure, and considering the end cover sealing is critical but likely less severe than full crankcase leakage, severity is assigned 7 (Reduced service/disatisfied customers due to lubrication failure and oil leakage). The occurrence is conservatively rated 4 (occasional occurrence) due to strong preventive measures in place but recognized risk of loosening from vibration and preload issues. Detection rating set to 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) because ultrasonic bolt measurement, vibration surveys, and MCE inspections are active detective controls enabling fairly good detection before customer impact, but some risk remains.

This adapts the retrieved ratings logically to the new engine type and front cover sealing context with similar but not exactly identical failure mode and cause.

Summary:
- Severity 7: Lubrication failure and oil leakage causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction.
- Occurrence 4: Occasional but controlled bolt loosening despite preventive measures.
- Detection 4: High likelihood of detecting bolt loosening before customer delivery via vibration and ultrasonic inspection measures."
Sealant/gasket aging and improper material selection,Simultaneous leakage of oil and coolant leading to cross-contamination and engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element End cover / Front housing, function sealing front end to prevent oil/coolant leak, failure mode sealant/gasket degradation causing simultaneous oil and coolant leakage with cross-contamination and engine damage. Retrieved data shows highly similar failure modes (e.g., 'Degradation of sealing over time' for front end housing in Gas Engine Type 4) with the identical system element (End cover / Front housing or analogous front end housing), similar failure modes and causes (sealant/gasket aging and improper material), and similar preventive and detective measures (design/spec to tolerances, supplier involvement, leakage test, endurance run). Given the close match in system element identity, failure mode, and measures, but difference in engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6), SIMILAR_CONTEXT is chosen. Severity in retrieved data for coolant in oil and coolant/oil leak (with cross-contamination risk) ranges from 5 to 7 for individual leak effects; combining oil and coolant leak with engine damage elevates severity to 8, reflecting significant engine damage and customer dissatisfaction but no clear regulatory violation. Occurrence rating is consistently 3 reflecting that preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate failure cause occurrence. Detection rating is 4 as leakage tests and endurance runs provide a high likelihood of detection before customer impact. Minor adjustment to severity from 5-7 to 8 to reflect combined oil and coolant leakage leading to engine damage, with occurrence and detection ratings taken directly from the analogous failure cause context due to identical preventive/detection effectiveness. Thus, Severity=8, Occurrence=3, Detection=4."
Humidity and corrosive environment in engine room affecting metal and sealing components,Gradual loss of sealing effectiveness leading to minor to major leakages over operating life,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element End cover / Front housing, with the failure mode 'Corrosion-induced degradation of sealing surfaces' caused by 'Humidity and corrosive environment in engine room'. The retrieved data shows multiple closely related failure modes within Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, focusing on front or rear end housings, dealing with sealing degradation or corrosion caused by humidity in engine room, with detailed preventive and detective measures including paints (RAIP 43200), design to specification, tolerance control, supplier involvement, and endurance testing inspection. Although the exact system element naming (End cover / Front housing) differs slightly in the retrieved data (often called 'Front end housing (damper housing)' or 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'), the functional context and failure effects align closely: degradation of sealing over time due to corrosion in humid environments causing leakage of oil or coolant. Severity ratings for similar failure effects like coolant/oil leaks or seal degradation are consistently rated between 5 and 7, reflecting moderate to significant process disturbance leading to customer dissatisfaction but without immediate regulatory violation or catastrophic failure. Occurrence ratings for corrosion due to humidity with similar preventive measures (paint, design specs, supplier involvement) are consistently low (2), indicating unlikely given the measures in place. Detection ratings with endurance run inspections and FPQ parts align with detection rating 4, representing high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes but not guaranteed. Given the high similarity in failure cause, failure mode, effects, preventive and detective measures, the retrieved ratings are fully applicable and adopted for the target context with no major adjustment needed."
"Contamination, corrosion deposits, or maintenance neglect",Pressure build-up causing sealing failure and associated leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 focusing on the Engine Block's Front Housing (End cover / Front housing) with a failure mode involving blockage of drain/ventilation ports caused by contamination, corrosion deposits, or maintenance neglect, leading to pressure build-up and sealing failure. The retrieved data covers a Gas Engine Type 4, same product category (gas engines), same subsystem and similar system element (front end housing/damper housing), with failure modes related to oil contamination, coolant leakage, sealing degradation, and related fluid leakage and pressure issues. The failure cause (contamination, corrosion deposits, maintenance neglect) and failure effect (pressure build-up causing sealing failure and leakage) closely resemble existing failure modes like 'Degradation of sealing over time,' 'Coolant leakage,' and 'Oil leakage,' with preventive and detective measures largely overlapping. Severity ratings for similar fluid leakage and sealing failure effects fall mostly between 5 and 7 depending on the exact failure effect, with leakage and environmental contamination effects rated around 5-7 and secondary damage or pressure loss effects rated slightly higher. Occurrence ratings for contamination and corrosion-related causes are typically low to moderate (2-3), while maintenance neglect-related occurrences can be higher (~3-5), depending on maintenance effectiveness. Detection ratings for these causes mostly range between 4 and 6, reflecting moderate detectability through test benches, leakage tests, endurance runs, and fluid monitoring, which match the preventive and detective measures in place for the target system. Given the similarity in product category, subsystem, system element, failure causes, effects, and alignment of measures, adapting the retrieved ratings is appropriate. Adjustments consider the slightly different engine type but similar design maturity and complexity. Therefore, severity is set at 7 (pressure build-up leading to sealing failure aligns with customers dissatisfied due to leakage issues), occurrence is set at 3 (occasional occurrence due to contamination and corrosion with preventive maintenance and cleanliness controls), and detection is set at 5 (detection possible mainly through targeted inspections and tests like leakage tests and monitoring but not certain before customer impact)."
Assembly process / Design for assembly - insufficient consideration of production and service requirements leading to difficult mounting and dismounting of timing gears and belts,"Increased service effort and risk of damage to front-end components such as timing gears, belts, and sensors during assembly or maintenance","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' focusing on the 'Engine Block' subsystem's 'End cover / Front housing' with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' caused by 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' leading to increased service effort and risk of damage during assembly/maintenance of timing gears, belts, and sensors. Retrieved data provides very similar failure modes ('Poor serviceability'), same failure cause ('Assembly process / Design for assembly'), within the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) from 'Gas Engine Type 4', but on slightly different components (CCV system, Front end housing damper housing). Preventive measures and detective measures in retrieved data closely match the target system measures. Failure effect severity varies in retrieved data depending on affected component and customer impact, showing severity ratings ranging from 2 (minor service disturbance) to 5 (process disturbance, high service effort with risk of damage). The failure effect described in target (increased service effort and risk of damage to timing gears/belts/sensors) suggests more customer-visible impact and potential risk for damage compared to small service disturbances in CCV or sensor routing systems but less severe than catastrophic failures. Given the functional similarity but more complex mechanical assembly and criticality of timing gears/belts/sensors, severity is estimated at 5 to 6 (process disturbance with risk of damage). Occurrence is aligned with retrieved rating of 5 for the same failure cause and preventive measures, indicating occasional occurrence despite preventive efforts. Detection rating is consistent at 4 in retrieved data with similar testbench and assembly inspection processes, indicating high likelihood of detection before customer delivery but not certain. Hence, severity is adapted slightly higher from 2 (minor) in retrieved to 5 or 6 to reflect more critical system impact. Occurrence and detection retained as per retrieval based on aligned preventive and detective measures. Final ratings: Severity=6 (process disturbance, risk of damage), Occurrence=5 (occasional occurrence), Detection=4 (high likelihood of detection before delivery)."
Front cover design does not provide adequate stiffness or reinforcement to support mounted timing gears and belts under operational loads and vibrations,Functional limitation due to misalignment of timing gears and belts causing timing inaccuracies and possible premature wear or failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' Engine Block subsystem, End cover / Front housing component, failure mode 'Lack of structural support' for mounting timing gears and belts is functionally very close to the failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' and 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' components of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. These retrieved failure modes share the same system element identity (front/end cover housing), function (providing structural support to mounted components), failure cause (design not providing sufficient stiffness or reinforcement), and similar preventive/detective measures. Hence, it fits the SIMILAR_CONTEXT category.

Severity is adjusted upward from retrieved 'Lack of structure for support' (which has severity 2 for minor sensor/wiring issues and rework) to reflect the stronger impact of timing gear and belt misalignment in the target engine type causing functional limitation, timing inaccuracies, and possible premature wear or failure. This impacts engine operation reliability, leading to customer dissatisfaction and possible financial implications from premature failure. Thus severity is rated 7 (Reduced service, customers dissatisfied).

Occurrence rating follows retrieved data for the failure cause 'Front/End cover design' under similar structural support issues at 3 (Low likelihood) reflecting the effectiveness of the extensive preventive measures like FEA, multi-body simulation, sensor positioning controls, design controls, and team involvement. The preventive measures in the target are consistent and extensive, justifying the retained occurrence rating.

Detection rating draws on the detection rating of 4 from retrieved 'Lack of structure for support' and related modes for 'Front/End cover design' causes, where multiple testbench overload, performance tests, assembly tests, endurance runs, and vibration measurements provide high likelihood detection before delivery. This aligns well with the target's listed detective measures. Therefore, detection rating is set at 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes).

Final ratings reflect a conservative but credible adjustment for a more consequential failure effect while respecting similar failure causes, subsystem context, and similar preventive/detective measures."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification or design inaccuracies in front housing leading to misalignment of mounting surfaces for timing gears and belts,Functional interruption due to improper gear meshing or belt tension loss resulting in timing system malfunction or engine performance degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Incorrect positioning of mounting features' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' involves geometry tolerance issues causing misalignment affecting timing gear and belt function. While no exact matches were found, closely related failure modes in the retrieved data include 'Incorrect positioning of sensors' and 'Incorrect positioning of locking pin' in similar engine block end covers/front housings from 'Gas Engine Type 4', with the same failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' and preventive measures 'Design acc. to specification, Tolerances acc. to specification, Tolerances stackup'. These failure modes share similar preventive/detective measures and likely environmental and manufacturing contexts given same product category and system element function (mounting interface misalignment). Differences lie in failure effect severity due to timing system malfunction causing engine performance degradation, which is more critical than sensor misalignments or locking pin positioning. 

Severity is adapted higher due to functional interruption and engine performance degradation (from retrieved effects mostly rated 2 for sensors positioning to a higher level reflecting system criticality). Occurrence rating is consistent at 3 considering effective design and tolerancing preventive measures. Detection rating remains at 6 due to reliance on assembly testing and performance tests similarly applied in retrieved contexts.

Hence, Severity = 7 (major functional impact and customer dissatisfaction due to timing issues), Occurrence = 3 (low likelihood with current preventive measures), Detection = 6 (only detected by targeted assembly and testbench inspections before delivery)."
"Bolted joint design flaws, improper gasket or O-ring specifications, or assembly misalignment causing oil or coolant leakage",Oil leakage to environment or internal contamination leading to lubrication failure or engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system involves 'Gas Engine Type 6', 'Engine Block' subsystem, and 'End cover / Front housing' system element, with failure mode 'Sealing failure at front housing interfaces' due to bolted joint design, gasket/O-ring specs, or assembly misalignment causing oil or coolant leakage. Retrieved data shows multiple similar failure modes related to oil leakage and sealing failures at front or end covers in the 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block' subsystem, including 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' and 'Degradation of sealing over time' at front housing or rear end cover. These have very similar preventive and detective measures and causes (bolted joint design, O-Ring specs, assembly process). Severity ratings for leakage to environment range from 7 to 10 depending on effect, with 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment' rated 10 indicating regulatory/financial impact, which matches the target failure effect. Occurrence ratings for bolted joint design and related causes cluster around 3-5 with good but not perfect preventive measures, and detection ratings range from 2 to 5 depending on failure mode details; given the target measures are quite comprehensive (VDI 2230 bolted joint calculation, FEA, ultrasonic bolt measurement, detailed assembly instructions, and validation tests), but considering realistic residual risk, occurrence and detection align closer to the mid-range values seen in Gas Engine Type 4 data. Total environment and customer impact (oil leakage causing engine damage or lubrication failure) justifies a severity = 10. Occurrence is set at 5 reflecting that despite good preventive controls, occasional issues in bolted joint or gasket/O-ring specs or assembly misalignment can still occur. Detection is set at 5 considering detection relies on functional MCE testing and field validation which are fairly rigorous but not guaranteed to catch all issues prior to customer impact. This balances the mature preventive and detective measures with some residual risk and detection uncertainty."
Bolted joint design,Loss of sealing function leading to coolant or oil leakage causing contamination and loss of pressure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and subsystem 'Engine Block' with system element 'End cover / Front housing' and failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' caused by 'Bolted joint design' directly corresponds to highly similar context entries from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem and similar components like 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' and 'Front end housing (damper housing)'. The failure effect 'Loss of sealing function leading to coolant or oil leakage causing contamination and loss of pressure' matches closely the effects 'Oil leak into environment' and 'Loss of oil pressure' with severity rated at 7 in this retrieved data. Preventive and detective measures in the target system closely align with those in retrieved data (FEA, Bolt joint calculation, preload measurement, leakage tests, MCE testbench etc.), indicating similar measures effectiveness. Minor differences between Type 6 and Type 4 gas engines can be expected but based on same product category (gas engines), same subsystem and similar functional context, ratings need only minor confirmation without major adjustments. Severity is consistently rated 7 due to customer impact of leakage and pressure loss dissatisfaction but no regulatory violation or catastrophic effect. Occurrence is rated 3 – low likelihood due to solid preventive design and simulation measures, consistent with retrieved data. Detection rating is 3 reflecting good detection likelihood via leakage tests, preload checks and extensive MCE testing before delivery. Therefore, final risk ratings are derived by direct adoption with SIMILAR_CONTEXT rationalization given strong alignment of failure mode, cause, effect, measures and product category."
Corrosion due to humidity in the engine room,Reduced sealing integrity resulting in leakage of fluids and potential engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, End cover / Front housing, degradation of sealing due to corrosion by humidity) closely matches multiple failure mode and cause entries from Gas Engine Type 4, specifically 'Degradation of sealing over time' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component within the Engine Block subsystem. The failure cause 'Corrosion due to humidity in the engine room' with the preventive measure 'Paint acc. to RAIP 43200' and detective measures including 'Endurance run - inspection of parts and fluids' and 'FPQ parts' matches exactly. This represents a similar context because both refer to gas engine blocks, engine front housing elements, identical failure modes and causes with same preventive/detective measures, only the engine type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4). Given strong similarity and identical context of failure mode, cause, preventive and detective measures, the existing ratings can be adopted with minor validation for any severity difference due to possible engine design impact. Since no indication of different severity or customer impact is present, severity ratings can be assumed consistent. Therefore, the occurrence is maintained at 2 (unlikely) reflecting effectiveness of painting preventive measure, and detection at 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) matching inspection measures. Severity is assigned as 7, matching the failure effect of reduced sealing integrity causing fluid leakage and potential engine damage, which is consistent with retrieved severity ratings for similar failure effects like 'oil leak into environment' or 'coolant/oil leak into environment' rated at 7."
O-Ring aging,"Loss of sealing capability causing fluid leakage, contamination, and pressure loss","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' (a similar product category and same subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing') with the failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' caused by 'O-Ring aging'. Retrieved data shows multiple exact matches for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with the same failure mode and cause but on slightly different components (e.g., 'Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'). These components share the function of sealing and supporting O-rings and gaskets. Preventive and detective measures are essentially equivalent, emphasizing design to specification, supplier involvement, maintenance schedule alignment, and extensive leakage/endurance testing. Severity ratings for related failure effects involving loss of sealing and leakage range from 5 (coolant in oil) to 7 (oil leak into environment, loss of pressure). For the specific failure effect 'Loss of sealing capability causing fluid leakage, contamination, and pressure loss' in the target context, a severity rating of 7 is appropriate, consistent with analogous effects rated 7 in retrieved data (loss of oil/coolant pressure, leak into environment). The retrieved occurrence rating for 'O-Ring aging' consistently is 3, reflecting a low likelihood due to strong preventive design and supplier controls. Detection rating ranges from 4 (high likelihood via leakage and endurance tests) to 6 in some related cases; however, the exact cause/mode pairing with the comprehensive detective measures given in the target system (leakage test, endurance run, assembly test, etc.) matches best with detection rating 4. Hence, the adapted risk ratings for the target system acknowledge the similarities in system function, preventive and detective controls but allow a slight refinement for the target's potentially harsher operating environment (Gas Engine Type 6 may have similar or slightly more demanding conditions) but no strong evidence to increase severity or occurrence. Detection remains effective due to multiple rigorous test methods in place."
Sealant / Gasket design,Inadequate sealing resulting in leakage and subsequent engine system performance degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Engine Block' subsystem, caused specifically by 'Sealant / Gasket design'. Retrieved evidence shows an exact failure mode and cause match in 'Gas Engine Type 4' in different but very similar engine block end cover/front housing components (front and rear end covers). Preventive and detective measures are very similar or almost identical. The product category (gas engine), system element (end cover/front housing), function (sealing), failure mode, failure cause, and effect are aligned, though the exact product version differs. Severity ratings for leakage-related effects in retrieved data range from 5 to 7, generally indicating moderate to customer-impacting effects (environmental contamination, loss of pressure). Occurrence ratings for this cause with similar preventive measures are consistently 3 (low likelihood). Detection ratings vary between 4 and 6 depending on tests, but given the comprehensive testbench and inspection procedures listed in target system, a detection rating of 4 is appropriate (Detection only through targeted inspection). Thus, retrieved ratings for the similar context: Severity = 7 (consistent with leakage and engine performance degradation causing customer dissatisfaction), Occurrence = 3 (low likelihood due to good design and supplier involvement), Detection = 4 (good coverage by leakage and endurance tests). Minor severity adaptation to 7 reflects customer dissatisfaction and performance impact due to leakage, matching retrieved effects such as 'Oil leak into environment' and 'Loss of oil pressure'. Therefore, risk ratings are adapted from retrieved similar context data considering slight severity increase due to system importance in Gas Engine Type 6."
Wrong maintenance activity plan,"Premature sealing failure causing leakage, pressure loss, and potential engine shutdown","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loss of sealing function due to improper maintenance' with cause 'Wrong maintenance activity plan' in 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block is closely analogous to the failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' with the same failure cause in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same product category and subsystem. The failure effects in the retrieved data show leakage, pressure loss, and potential engine shutdown, which align well with the target effects of premature sealing failure causing leakage, pressure loss, and potential engine shutdown. Severity ratings for similar leakage and pressure loss events are commonly rated as 7, indicating customers’ dissatisfaction and reduced service due to engine shutdown risk. Preventive measures in the target are comparable to those in the retrieved data, with 'Design life according to maintenance schedule' and involving service teams matching existing effective controls. The occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood) from retrieved data matches the effectiveness of these preventive measures; there is not very frequent failure, but wrong maintenance can still occur occasionally. Detection is rated 7 due to 'Field validation' (same as in retrieved contexts), indicating no certain detection before customer impact and a likelihood of customer detection. Given the high consequence of engine shutdown, severity is set to 7 consistent with catalogued ratings. Occurrence and detection ratings are adopted from the retrieved data and fit well. Thus, the exact failure cause and mode are found but in a similar system generation context (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6), justifying use of SIMILAR_CONTEXT with no significant rating adjustment needed."
Assembly process / Design for assembly issues,Immediate sealing failure resulting in leakage and compromised sealing function,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Functional interruption due to assembly defects' in the End cover / Front housing of the Engine Block subsystem. Retrieved data include similar failure modes related to sealing failure due to assembly or design for assembly issues in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' components within the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem context (Engine Block). Preventive and detective measures are very similar, involving cross-team design involvement, RAIP, FPQ checks, test bench testing, leakage and endurance runs, and monitoring. Severity ratings for immediate sealing failure causing leakage are consistently high (7-8 for reduced service and dissatisfaction, up to 10 when leakage affects environment). Occurrence for assembly-related defects consistently rated around 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting presence but controlled by extensive preventive measures. Detection ratings vary between 4 and 6 depending on inspection methods, but with robust leakage and functional testing, a rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) is appropriate. Given the target failure effect is an immediate sealing failure causing leakage (critical functional interruption), severity is set at 8 reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and functional interruption but no direct regulatory violation or catastrophic failure noted. Occurrence is maintained at 5 consistent with retrieved data for assembly/design issues with similar preventive measures. Detection set at 5 given the availability of leakage tests and functional test benches but no guaranteed early detection before delivery. Adjustments reflect the shift from 'over time leakage' to 'immediate sealing failure.'"
"['Inadequate assembly process or design for assembly leading to difficult sensor installation or maintenance', 'Inappropriate front/end cover design not aligning with sensor specifications or mounting requirements', 'Incorrect geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specifications affecting sensor fitment', 'Insufficient involvement of service and hardware teams during design phase', 'Unsuitable sensor specification not compatible with mounting provisions']","['Increased service effort due to difficult access or removal of sensors', 'Damage to interface components or sensors during service procedures']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, element End cover / Front housing, failure mode Poor serviceability caused by various design and assembly issues impacting sensor installation and service. Retrieved data show detailed ratings for a highly similar context: Gas Engine Type 4, subsystem Engine Block, front end housing (damper housing) component, failure mode Poor serviceability with near identical failure causes and effects on sensor installation/serviceability. The preventive and detective measures in both contexts align closely. Severity ratings for the failure effects 'Increased service effort' and 'Damage during service' are consistently rated 2 (minor customer disturbance). Occurrence ratings for assembly/process-related causes cluster around 5 (occasional occurrence), and design-related causes around 3 (low to occasional occurrence), detection ratings mostly at 4 (high likelihood of detection through extensive tests including assembly and endurance tests). Given the strong similarity in product category, subsystem, system element function, failure mode, failure causes, failure effects, and alignment of existing preventive/detection measures, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable. Slight differences in engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) are unlikely to significantly change the risk ratings because the fundamental design challenges and interfaces remain similar, and preventive/detection rigor is comparable. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are adopted with no adjustment."
"['Assembly errors or poor design for assembly resulting in misaligned sensor mounting points', 'Insufficiently accurate tolerance specifications or geometry deviations', 'Deficiencies in end cover design impacting sensor location accuracy', 'Influence of starter system components affecting sensor positioning', 'Improper bolted joint design causing sensor misplacement']","['Increased service effort to correct sensor alignment', 'Damage to sensors and interface components due to misalignment']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context concerns 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block front end cover housing providing installation space and mounting points for sensors, with failure mode of 'Incorrect positioning of sensors' caused by assembly/design errors, tolerance issues, and bolted joint design defects. Retrieved data shows a very similar failure mode 'Incorrect positioning of sensors' in the 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' engine block, with overlapping failure causes including starter system influence, assembly/design for assembly, bolted joint design, crankcase design, geometry tolerances, and cover design. Both contexts share preventive and detective measures and function of providing sensor installation space. The main difference is the subsystem component (front housing vs rear end cover), and engine system generation (Type 6 vs Type 4). Severity ratings for failure effects 'Increased service effort' and 'Damage during service (interface components, sensors)' are low (2) in retrieved data, reflecting customer impact limited to increased service cost and component damage but no regulatory or critical safety violation. Given the similar product category, system element, and function, severity remains consistent at 2. Occurrence ratings in retrieved data range around 3 (for design/tolerance causes) to 5 for assembly-related causes, considering existing preventive measures similar in scope and depth to target system (comprehensive design reviews, FPQ, assembly instructions, simulations, involvement of multiple teams). Hence, occurrence ratings should remain consistent: around 3 to 5 depending on specific cause but given the multiple failure causes grouped, a nominal value of 4 (occasional occurrence) is appropriate. Detection ratings in retrieved data vary between 3 to 6 depending on cause and failure mode: assembly test, leakage test, endurance run, MCE testbench performance tests provide moderate to good chances of detection before customer impact but not fully certain. The target system's detective measures are comparable or slightly stronger (including bolted joint preload measurement), so overall detection rating is evaluated as 4 (high likelihood of detection before delivery). This balances the imperfect but multiple detective methods. Summary: Severity 2 (minor increased service effort, component damage), Occurrence 4 (occasional despite preventive measures), Detection 4 (high likelihood of detection but not guaranteed). Ratings reflect consistent impact and control effectiveness adapted to the similar front housing sensor installation context of Gas Engine Type 6."

Preventive and detective measures are very similar or essentially the same. Given similarities, the retrieved risk ratings can be adapted with minimal adjustment considering consistent severity impacts on sensor failures and rework, as well as existing robust preventive and detective controls. Severity is correspondingly low (effect localized to sensor/wiring failures and retrofit efforts) rated 2. Occurrence is medium-low due to preventive design, simulation, and multi-team involvement, thus rated 3 for root cause occurrence. Detection is quite effective due to multiple end-of-line and endurance tests for assembly and sensor functionality, rated 4. These ratings reflect the slight increase in system sophistication from Gas Engine Type 4 to Type 6 but maintain rating consistency given close engineering and product similarities."
Inadequate vibration damping design or fastening leading to loosening of cable clamps,Intermittent electrical faults due to cable movement or connector loosening,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, focusing on the Engine Front/End Cover guiding and securing cables against vibration-induced loosening causing intermittent electrical faults. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Front-End Housing and End Cover components include a highly similar and related failure mode 'Vibration is too high' with causes including 'Front/End cover design' and associated preventive and detective measures highly matching the target measures. The failure effect of 'Intermittent electrical faults due to cable movement or connector loosening' aligns closely to documented 'Sensor failure' or 'Loosening of bolted joints' due to vibration, where severity ratings range moderately lower (4) when sensors involved, or higher (7-8) for structural bolt loosening/damage. Given that the target failure mode affects electrical connector interface reliability intermittently but does not lead to direct regulatory violation or catastrophic failure, the severity is assigned a mid-level rating consistent with sensor/electrical intermittent faults, around 4-6. Preventive measures from the retrieved context are similar in scope and effectiveness, supporting Occurrence = 3 as preventive design and simulation tools are used and tolerances maintained, with some residual risk of occasional occurrence due to vibration complexity. Detection measures are robust testbench and inspection processes similar to retrieved context of vibration-related bolt joint and front/end cover design failure causes, supporting Detection = 6 indicating detection by targeted inspections and test runs but no guaranteed early detection pre-delivery. Ratings are adapted slightly towards the conservative side given Type 6 engine might have slightly higher complexity and customer impact than Type 4 but fundamentally similar context. Hence final ratings: Severity=5 (moderate process/customer impact due to intermittent faults), Occurrence=3 (low likelihood due to strong preventive design), Detection=6 (inspection-based detection)."
Material fatigue or improper design leading to stress concentration and crack initiation,"Loss of effective load transmission, possible engine damage due to misalignment or component detachment","SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Structural cracking or deformation of end cover due to load stress' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of Gas Engine Type 6 is functionally and contextually very close to the retrieved failure modes labeled 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Front/End cover design' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' components within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4. Both involve structural integrity and load-transmission functions, with failure causes related to material/design issues and fatigue/stress concentration. Preventive and detective measures strongly overlap, including design process involvement, FEA, simulations, and endurance and assembly tests. The severity ratings for structural failure effects reported are high (8), reflecting significant customer impact and potential engine damage. Occurrence ratings for similar design and material fatigue causes are consistently low (3), reflecting effective preventive controls, except for assembly/process related causes which are higher (5), but here the specific cause is material fatigue/design leading to stress concentration, thus occurrence 3 applies. Detection ratings with extensive test bench and endurance inspections correspond to detection rating 4. Considering the similarities and matching preventive/detective measures, the ratings from 'Insufficient structural support' front/end cover design-related failure cause are adapted directly. Severity rating is 8 (reduced service due to structural failure causing engine damage risk), Occurrence rating is 3 (low likelihood due to robust design and controls), Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection via existing test and inspection methods before customer impact)."
"Manufacturing tolerances, assembly errors, or thermal distortion causing positional deviation",Uneven load distribution causing premature bearing wear or damage to attached components such as crankshaft or timing gear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode ('Misalignment between end cover and engine block affecting load path') occurs within the same system element context (end cover / front housing of engine block) and product category (Gas Engine) although on 'Gas Engine Type 6' vs 'Gas Engine Type 4' in retrieved data. The failure cause (manufacturing tolerances, assembly errors, or thermal distortion causing positional deviation) is conceptually similar to 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' failure causes found in retrieved documents. Preventive measures like design to specification, tolerance stackup, and involvement of production and design teams match well. Detective measures such as assembly tests, preload measurements, vibration and endurance testing also map closely. However, the failure effect for target is premature bearing wear and damage to critical rotating components, implying a potentially higher severity than minor positioning inaccuracies in the retrieved data but less severe than structural failure or leakage. The severity rating can be aligned with severe mechanical consequences but short of a regulation violation or catastrophic failure. Thus, severity is evaluated as 7 (significant component damage causing reduced service/dissatisfaction). Existing strong preventive measures justify Occurrence rating of 3 (low likelihood). Existing comprehensive detection activities justify Detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection before customer delivery). Overall, risk ratings are adapted from similar failure modes in engine block end cover and front housing designs but adjusted upwards in severity due to critical nature of bearing and crankshaft damage potential."
"Inadequate gasket or seal material degradation, improper surface finish or bolted joint design",Oil leakage leading to reduced lubrication efficiency and environmental contamination,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Lack of sealing between end cover and engine block' with causes like 'Inadequate gasket or seal material degradation, improper surface finish or bolted joint design' in the subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'End cover / Front housing' is highly similar to retrieved failure modes related to sealing degradation or oil leakage in engine block components such as 'Degradation of sealing over time' (front end housing, rear end cover) and 'Oil leakage' or 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase' in Gas Engine Type 4, same product category, but slightly different system elements or engine types. The failure effects (oil leakage causing environmental contamination and loss of lubrication efficiency) correspond to severity levels in the range 7 due to environmental contamination and lubrication loss impacts. Preventive measures in retrieved data (FEA, bolted joint calculation, gasket design involvement of supplier, design per specification, and maintenance scheduling) match very well with the target's existing preventive measures. Detective measures (leakage test, assembly test, endurance run with inspection, preload measurement, test benches) correspond also very closely, suggesting detection ratings of moderate to good detectability. Based on this similarity, severity rating is aligned with effects causing reduced lubrication and environment contamination, rated as 7. Occurrence rating adopts a moderate value (3) reflecting preventive design and engineering measures effectively in place, but acknowledging that gasket degradation and surface finish issues may still cause occasional failures. Detection rating is evaluated as 4, reflecting assembly and test bench inspections that allow detection prior to field delivery but not 100% certain. Ratings from the retrieved similar contexts were adapted slightly for the exact subsystem and failure mode effects in the Gas Engine Type 6, consistent with existing measures and detected failure causes."
Poor joint stiffness or resonance conditions due to structural or design deficiencies,"Increased wear or failure of attached components such as timing chains, sensors, or cooling system parts","SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data shows a highly similar failure mode 'Vibration is too high' occurring in the engine block subsystem's front end housing and crankcase of the Gas Engine Type 4, affecting structural support and sensor installations. The target failure mode 'Excessive vibration transmission through the end cover to attached systems' in the Gas Engine Type 6 end cover/front housing shares the same system element identity, function (load transmission and structural support), failure mode, failure cause (poor joint stiffness or resonance), and similar failure effects (increased wear or failure of attached components like sensors). Preventive and detective measures also align closely (FEA, MBS, simulation, assembly and endurance tests, vibration measurement, oil/coolant monitoring). Differences include a newer engine generation (Type 6 vs Type 4) which might have slight improvements in design and measures. Considering this, the severity ratings for related effects are consistent, so severity is taken directly as 7 (increased wear/damage to attached components). Occurrence is maintained at 3 given the established preventive measures' proven effectiveness but some residual risk. Detection remains at 6, reflecting detection through targeted inspections and endurance/vibration testing as in the retrieved context. Overall, the similar context allows strong rating adaptation with minor contextual consideration."
"Design flaws causing load path redirection, such as missing isolation elements or excessive rigidity",Localized overstressing leading to accelerated fatigue damage in engine block or end cover,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Overfunctioning by unintended load transfer through end cover to engine block' in the Gas Engine Type 6 at the Engine Block subsystem with the End cover / Front housing element and related loading function is highly similar in structural and functional context to the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' observed in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem. Both failure modes involve structural design flaws leading to load path issues causing localized overstressing and subsequent fatigue damage. The failure causes (design flaws, missing isolation, excessive rigidity) align with 'Front/End cover design' and associated design cause categories. Preventive and detective measures are consistent and comparable in scope and rigor. Given this, the retrieved ratings for occurrence and detection in the Gas Engine Type 4 context can be adapted with slight consideration for potentially higher engine type/model robustness or complexity. Severity aligns with structural damage and fatigue leading to high severity effects (dissatisfaction from reliability issues, possible costly repairs). Therefore, severity is rated as 8 (matching structural overstressing with fatigue damage), occurrence is moderately low at 3 reflecting effective design controls and preventive measures, and detection at 4 reflecting good but not absolute detection capability from various test bench endurance and inspection methods."
Structural design flaw causing the end cover to transmit excessive loads to auxiliary devices or engine block,"Premature fatigue failure in end cover, auxiliary device mounts, or connected engine block parts","SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target failure mode 'Overfunction by unintended load transmission' for the 'End cover / Front housing' in Gas Engine Type 6 corresponds closely to failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high' and 'Insufficient structural support' in 'Front/End cover design' for Gas Engine Type 4 in the engine block subsystem. Though the exact failure mode and cause were not found, the retrieved data on structural design-related issues with preventive and detective measures almost identical to those in the target system indicate strong contextual similarity. Both contexts involve structural loads causing fatigue or damage to the end cover, auxiliary mounts and related engine components, with preventive measures such as FEA, multibody simulation, design verification, and service team involvement. Severity for similar failure effects (fatigue, damage on interface components, loosening) in retrieved data is rated 7–8, Occurrence ratings for structural design causes consistently range around 3 considering extensive preventive design control, and Detection ratings are commonly 6 due to thorough testing and inspections (e.g., testbench overload, endurance runs, FPQ parts inspections). The slightly higher severity of premature fatigue failure on critical structural parts (target) aligns best with a 8. Given preventive measures applied and moderate risk of design flaws still occurring occasionally, occurrence is rated 3. Detective measures are robust (testbench tests, endurance inspection, vibration measurements), supporting a detection rating of 6 as failures are usually detected before customer impact. Ratings are adapted slightly upwards in severity (from 7 in vibration mode) to reflect the criticality of premature fatigue failure as opposed to vibration-induced noise or loosening only. Overall ratings reflect consistent reasoning applied for structurally induced fatigue failure under design flaw causes in similar gas engine systems."
Design weaknesses such as insufficient material thickness or improper reinforcement,Loss of mounting integrity and potential auxiliary device detachment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, specifically for End cover / Front housing with failure mode 'Structural fatigue cracking' caused by design weaknesses (insufficient material thickness or improper reinforcement) leading to loss of mounting integrity and potential auxiliary device detachment. Retrieved data covers Gas Engine Type 4 in the same Engine Block subsystem and very similar system elements (Front end housing, Rear end cover), with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and related design issues. Preventive and detective measures are largely overlapping and comparable in rigor and scope, including design involvement teams, FEA, simulation tools, and extensive testbench and endurance inspections. The failure effect severity in retrieved cases related to structural support failure (resulting in damage to interface components, loosening of bolts, and lack of stiffness) is rated severity 8, reflecting serious consequences but not regulatory or massive financial violation (which aligns well with the auxiliary device detachment risk in the target). Occurrence ratings for design-related causes in retrieved data are consistently 3, reflecting low likelihood due to strong preventive design involvement and analysis. Detection ratings vary from 3 to 4, representing high likelihood detection during testing and assembly due to testbench and inspection regimes matching the target's detection measures. Therefore, adapting this to the Gas Engine Type 6 End Cover with similar failure cause and effect, the severity is rated 8 (serious mounting integrity loss and customer dissatisfaction), occurrence is rated 3 (low likelihood with good preventive design measures), and detection is rated 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes including testbench and assembly inspections). This adaptation considers the similarity of product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effects with minor updates for the slightly different engine type and specific component naming."
Inadequate corrosion protection or environmental sealing,"Loss of structural strength, increased maintenance, or eventual failure","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, End cover / Front housing element, with failure mode 'Corrosion leading to material weakening' caused by 'Inadequate corrosion protection or environmental sealing'. The retrieved data includes multiple failure modes and causes in Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, similar structural components (front end housing, rear end cover) with corrosion-related causes and use of paint per RAIP 43200 as preventive measure. The failure mode is close to 'Degradation of sealing over time' or 'Coolant leakage' where corrosion due to humidity and paint protection are identified and rated. Although the exact failure mode (corrosion material weakening) is not present, corrosion causing leakage and sealing degradation parallels exist. Severity for corrosion-induced structural weakening causing loss of structural strength and potential failure is estimated higher than leakage effects, as it risks structural integrity and auxiliary device mounting. Occurrence is driven by similar preventive measure (paint acc. to RAIP 43200) and environmental exposure, consistent with low occurrence from retrieved data (rated 2). Detection via endurance run and final parts quality inspection is similar and corresponds to detection rating 4 in corrosion-related failure modes. Adjusted Severity is set at 7 due to structural importance and potential customer dissatisfaction and maintenance impact, occurrence at 2 reflecting effective painting preventive measure, and detection at 4 reflecting moderate detection likelihood via endurance run and FPQ parts."
Design lacking sufficient structural support causing end cover to bear engine operational loads,Premature fatigue or fracture of the cover; compromised engine block integrity; safety risk,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' focused on the 'Engine Block' subsystem's 'End cover / Front housing' element with the failure mode regarding unintended structural load-bearing by the end cover, causing premature fatigue or fracture and compromising engine integrity and safety. Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' shows very similar failure modes ('Insufficient structural support', 'Lack of structure for support') in structurally comparable components (front end housing, rear end cover) within the same engine block subsystem and product category. The failure cause 'Front/End cover design' and the associated preventive and detective measures are highly consistent with the target system's measures. Severity ratings for effects related to compromised structural integrity and safety risks are high (around 8 for damage and failure effects threatening integrity and safety). Occurrence ratings for similar design-related failure causes range between 3 and 5 considering preventive design and assembly involvement. Detection ratings vary between 3 and 4 reflecting effective MCE testbench and endurance testing measures similar to the target system's measures. Hence, the risk ratings are adapted from the retrieved similar context with no evidence of decreased risk control or increased impact severity for the newer engine type. Severity is set high (8) due to safety risk and structural integrity compromise. Occurrence is rated as 3 due to robust preventive design and cross-team involvement reducing likelihood. Detection is rated 4 given comprehensive testbench and endurance testing with some residual detection uncertainty before customer delivery."
Fatigue induced microcracks or intermittent loosening under transient dynamic loads,Fluctuating vibration levels resulting in noise and potential acceleration of wear in connected components,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with reasoning: The target failure mode 'Functional fluctuation - variable stiffness from joint looseness or microcracking' in the Baseframe of the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6 shows no exact or close match in the retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 or similar components. Existing referenced failure modes deal primarily with leakage, insufficient structural support, sealing degradation, and vibration issues, but do not specifically address fluctuating stiffness due to fatigue-induced microcracks or transient loosening under dynamic loads in the baseframe. While some vibration and loosening-related failure causes exist, the specific effect of fluctuating stiffness causing vibration and accelerated wear is more structural and subtle, without direct analogous failure causes/effects in the data. Therefore, rating must be generated using the provided rating schema and analysis of preventive and detective measures effectiveness in the new system context. 

Severity: The effect is 'fluctuating vibration levels resulting in noise and potential acceleration of wear in connected components'. This causes customer dissatisfaction via noise and potential reduced durability, but does not violate regulations or cause immediate safety risk. Considering severity scale, this aligns with a mid-high severity due to functional disturbance and customer dissatisfaction related to noise and wear acceleration. No catastrophic failure or direct regulatory issues are described, so Severity = 7.

Occurrence: Preventive measures are robust, including design per specification, tolerance management, bolt joint VDI2230 calculations, detailed FEA (including transient dynamic loads), and cross-team involvement (production, controls, service). These measures should reduce fatigue crack initiation and joint loosening effectively, but fatigue and transient loads still present an inherent risk with some possibility of microcracks or intermittent loosening developing over time. This suggests an Occurrence in the occasional to low frequent range, but less than frequent since prevention is well covered. Occurrence = 4.

Detection: Detective measures include multiple MCE testbench tests (overload, performance, start/stop), assembly and endurance inspections including parts and fluids, vibration measurements, and bolted joint preload measurements. These measures provide good but not guaranteed early detection of fluctuating stiffness or loosening as vibration measurement and preload checks can detect early signs, but microcracks might be hard to detect immediately in assembly or tests. Detection is likely possible before delivery, but is not certain. Detection rating falls between 'high likelihood in subsequent processes' and 'detection only by targeted inspection'. Assign Detection = 4.

Summary: Severity=7 accurately reflects customer dissatisfaction and downstream wear impact; Occurrence=4 indicates moderate likelihood despite good prevention; Detection=4 reflects reasonable but not certain early detection capability."
Inadequate structural design of baseframe leading to insufficient stiffness or strength,Increased vibration transmission to connected engine components causing accelerated fatigue damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loss of function - Baseframe fails to absorb vibrational forces' with cause 'Inadequate structural design leading to insufficient stiffness or strength' and effect 'Increased vibration transmission causing accelerated fatigue damage' closely matches multiple retrieved failure modes in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4, particularly the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in structural components like front end housing and rear end cover. Although the exact component is different (baseframe vs housing/end cover), the system element (structural support element of the engine block) and failure effect (increased vibration/transmission causing damage) are effectively the same, and preventive/detective measures have significant overlap. Preventive measures such as FEA, MBS, tolerance control, bolt joint calculation and multidisciplinary team involvement are common, as are detective measures including test bench performance, endurance and vibration measurement tests. Because the baseframe supports vibrational forces similarly to the housing components, severity and occurrence can be adapted from these highly similar cases. Severity is adapted to 8 (consistent with 'Damage on interface components' and 'Lack of stiffness' effects causing accelerated fatigue reported). Occurrence is estimated at 3 considering robust preventive measures in mature Gas Engine designs. Detection rating is assigned 4 since multiple targeted inspections and testbench measurements are in place, increasing chance of detection before customer delivery but not absolutely certain. This rating aligns well to the level of detective efforts described in retrieved data for similar design-caused structural insufficiencies."
Harmonic excitation frequencies matching the natural frequency of the baseframe due to design or assembly variations,High local vibrations leading to premature loosening of attached components and noise issues,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Overfunction - Baseframe exhibits excessive vibration resonance amplification' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has strong similarity to the retrieved failure mode 'Vibration is too high' occurring in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both involve structural components absorbing vibrational loads, experiencing excessive vibration from harmonic excitation or resonance. Functions relate to structural support and handling vibration. Preventive and detective measures overlap significantly, including design involvement, FEA/modal analysis, bolted joint design per VDI 2230, geometry tolerances, MBS simulations, and various vibration tests and endurance runs. The retrieved 'Vibration is too high' failure mode uses a Severity rating of 7 for high vibration causing loosening and noise issues, which aligns well with 'High local vibrations leading to premature loosening of attached components and noise issues'. Occurrence ratings for analogous failure causes (assembly/design for assembly, bolted joint design, geometry tolerances, transient engine operation) range mostly from 3 to 5, reflecting occasional to low-frequent occurrence considering strong preventive measures. Detection ratings from retrieved data are consistently at 6 (detection via targeted inspection) for similar causes and measures, reflecting extensive vibration and assembly checks but no guaranteed early detection before delivery. Considering the Type 6 engine may have a similar or slightly more robust design and manufacturing maturity, but similar vibration challenges remain, the ratings are kept consistent with slight consideration to context consistency. Thus, severity set at 7 (reduced service / customer dissatisfaction due to loosening and noise issues), occurrence at 4 (occasional occurrence due to strong preventive design and assembly controls), and detection at 6 (inspection-based detection including vibration monitoring and preload measurement) best match and adapt the retrieved context to the target system."
Incorrect installation or offset alignment causing unintended load paths,Unintended vibration transfer causing failure in engine mounts or nearby sensors,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT based on matching system element (baseframe corresponds functionally to structural support elements like front end housing and rear end cover baseframes in Gas Engine Type 4), same product category (gas engines), engine block subsystem, function related to absorbing/distributing vibrations, and failure cause tied to incorrect installation/alignment which aligns with assembly process/design for assembly causes in retrieved data. Failure mode 'Unintended function - Baseframe transmits vibrational forces' is closely related to failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Vibration is too high' in retrieved data of similar engine block components. Severity is adapted to severity 8 level (damage to mounts or sensors akin to damage on interface components, loosening of bolts rated 8). Occurrence is aligned with assembly process related causes rated occurrence 5 due to existing comprehensive preventive efforts (design involvement, tolerances, simulations). Detection rating is adapted from vibration measurement and endurance tests with detection ratings generally 4 to 6; given extensive MCE testbench and vibration measurements noted, detection rating is set at 4 (high likelihood of detection pre-delivery) reflecting ability to catch misalignment-caused vibration transmission during assembly and test phases. Ratings are consistent with the reliability of preventive/detective measures and reflect realistic risk in the target context."
Geometry tolerances or incorrect fabrication causing asymmetrical stiffness in baseframe,Localized stress concentration and early fatigue failures in high-stress areas,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT based on the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), and closely related system element (Baseframe structurally similar to Front end housing and Rear end cover components) with failure causes related to geometry tolerances and fabrication causing uneven stiffness. Retrieved data for similar failure causes (geometry tolerances/wrong tolerance specification) in 'Insufficient structural support' failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 Engine Block show occurrence=3 and detection=4 under similar preventive and detective measures; severity for localized stress and fatigue failures is high (approx. severity 8). Due to the failure mode description (incorrect vibrational force distribution causing local stress concentration and early fatigue failures), severity is consistent with high structural damage effects (severity=8). Occurrence is maintained at 3 due to effective preventive design controls and tolerance specifications, simulation, and team involvement. Detection rating is 4 as the existing measures (MCE testbench tests, vibration measurement, endurance runs, oil/coolant monitoring, FPQ parts) align well with detection capabilities in similar contexts. Minor adaptation from Type 4 to Type 6 engines is justified without rating adjustment because preventive/detective measures are comprehensive and failure nature is similar."
Material defects or high vibration levels causing crack initiation and propagation,Loss of structural integrity and alignment loss causing engine shutdown or catastrophic failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode is 'Functional interruption due to baseframe cracking' caused by 'Material defects or high vibration levels causing crack initiation and propagation' in the 'Baseframe' system element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of the 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved data contains failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high', 'Vibration & Thermal transfer', and structural integrity issues in similar engine block components (Crankcase, Front end housing) of 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same product category. Although the exact component (Baseframe) is not found, the baseframe's function of maintaining alignment and structural integrity closely relates to structural failures induced by vibration, fatigue, and material defects in components like the crankcase and front end housing. Preventive and detective measures described for these components are highly similar to those in the target system (FEA, bolt joint calculations, vibration simulations, endurance testing, bolted joint inspection). 

Severity rating must reflect the loss of structural integrity leading to engine shutdown or catastrophic failure, which is critical. Retrieved related severities for structural failure and loosening bolted joints causing engine trips or shutdowns range typically 7-8 (fatigue related damage causing functional loss) and up to 10 for catastrophic gas leakage failure. Given the catastrophic failure potential in the baseframe compromising alignment and shutting the engine down, Severity is rated at 9. This aligns with retrieved definitions for regulatory/financial-impact failure.

Occurrence is influenced by effective preventive measures: detailed FEA, bolt joint calculations, vibration simulations, and robust design involvement of multidisciplinary teams. Retrieved occurrence ratings for similar vibration-related structural failures with preventive design involvement range mostly between 3 and 5 (occasional to low likelihood), reflecting the effectiveness of current preventive measures. Because the baseframe is critical but involved in thorough simulations and specification adherence, occurrence rating is conservatively set at 4 (occasional occurrence).

Detection ratings for vibration-related crack initiation in similar components with extensive MCE testbench tests, vibration measurements, and bolted joint inspections are mostly rated 6, indicating detection only through targeted inspection, not visible during early production or assembly phases. Because crack initiation is often subtle and requires specific testbench tests and vibration monitoring, Detection rating is also set at 6.

Thus, the ratings are adapted from similar vibrational structural failure scenarios within the same product category and functional context, with adjustments for the higher criticality (severity) and conservative estimates of occurrence and detection based on existing measures."
Geometry tolerances stack-up inducing stiffness mismatch and resonance,Amplification of vibration affecting sensors and sensitive external equipment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Baseframe'. The failure mode is 'Overfunction - unintended transmission of vibration at specific frequencies' caused by 'Geometry tolerances stack-up inducing stiffness mismatch and resonance', leading to amplification of vibration affecting sensors and sensitive external equipment. The retrieved data contains several relevant FMEA entries from 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same subsystem (Engine Block) and related elements handling vibration issues ('Vibration is too high' failure mode and related causes including 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'). Although the exact failure mode and system element are not identical (Baseframe vs Front end housing or crankcase), the functional context of vibration transmission and sensor effect is closely matched. Preventive and detective measures for 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' failure cause are highly similar, involving specification adherence, tolerance stack-up analysis, simulation (1D), and extensive testbench and endurance vibration measurements. Severity in the reference context for vibration effects impacting sensors is rated at 4 (sensor function failure) or 7 (fatigue damage/interface components) depending on the specific effect, but since the target effect is amplification affecting sensors and sensitive external equipment (likely sensor malfunction but also potential external damage), a moderate to high severity rating is appropriate around 7 to reflect customer dissatisfaction and some functional impairment without regulatory violation. Occurrence is rated at 3 in the reference data for the same preventive measures (design per specification, tolerance control, simulation), because these measures reduce frequency to low likelihood. Detection rating in the reference cases is generally 6—detection mainly via targeted inspections such as vibration measurement and endurance runs but no certain or automatic detection prior to customer. The target system has equivalent preventive and detective measures, supporting similar ratings. Thus, we adapt the reference ratings with slight consideration that baseframe vibrations might impact sensors more directly or subtly, justifying the same or slightly enhanced severity. Overall, the ratings for Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=6 best reflect the similarity in cause, effect, and controls, adapted reasonably from Gas Engine Type 4 data to the Gas Engine Type 6 baseframe context."
Design omissions or tolerance stack-up errors causing missing or weak attachment points,"Auxiliary systems not securely mounted, leading to vibrations, noise, or system malfunction","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Retrieved data show multiple failure modes 'Lack of structure for support' and 'Insufficient structural support' occurring in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4, with components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'. These failure modes and causes closely match the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' Baseframe structural support failure due to design omissions or tolerance stack-up errors. Preventive and detective measures are highly aligned, involving thorough design team integration, specification compliance, FEA, tolerance stack-up analysis, and extensive MCE test bench and endurance testing. The failure effect in the target is auxiliary systems not securely mounted causing vibrations, noise, or malfunction, which strongly aligns with 'Damage on interface components', 'Loosening of bolts', and 'Lack of stiffness' failure effects in retrieved data, all rated Severity 8 (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction due to malfunction). Since severity ratings in retrieved data for comparable structural support failures are 8, this value fits well for the target's failure effect (vibration and malfunction impacting customer satisfaction and system function). Occurrence ratings for causes like design omissions/tolerance stack-up are mostly around 3 (low likelihood) to 5 (occasional) depending on cause and design integration, matching the well-implemented preventive measures listed. Detection ratings are mostly 4 (high likelihood of detection through testing/assembly/endurance runs), consistent with the strong detective measures at testbench and assembly levels. Therefore, adapting the similar context ratings: Severity=8 (consistent impact on subsystem/customer), Occurrence=4 (occasional occurrence given good design and tolerance processes but residual risk from omissions or stack-up), Detection=4 (high probability of detecting issue before delivery via extensive testing and inspection). This accounts for the advanced design and testing environment of Gas Engine Type 6 compared to Type 4, but similar subsystem function and failure consequences."
Design not optimized for maintenance access or assembly process deficiencies,"Increased service effort, prolonged downtime, and higher maintenance costs","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Poor serviceability' failure mode caused by 'Design not optimized for maintenance access or assembly process deficiencies' in the 'Baseframe' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved data shows very similar failure mode 'Poor serviceability' with similar failure causes (design for maintenance, assembly process/design for assembly) in 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 4', specifically in components closely related functionally (Crankcase, CCV system, Front end housing). The function is also related to providing installation/routing/access space, which aligns well with 'Provide channels and attachment points for routing auxiliary systems' in Baseframe. Preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data overlap or closely resemble the target system's existing measures. However, differences exist due to slightly different product types (Type 4 vs Type 6), and Baseframe may have slightly higher impact on service effort due to its core structural role compared to CCV or front housing components. Severity in retrieved data for poor serviceability causing 'increased service effort' ranges from 2 (less severe effect in front housing) to 5 (noted in CCV system and crankcase context) which better corresponds to increased service effort and prolonged downtime noted in target. Occurrence for failure causes related to assembly/design for maintenance mostly range around 3 to 5 depending on cause, consistent with moderate chance despite preventive measures. Detection ratings for assembly process/design for assembly and design for maintenance causes are mostly in range 2-4 indicating moderate to good detection by tests and field validations, matching the existing detective measures in target. Analytical Reasoning: Severity adjusted to 5 to reflect increased service effort and downtime (more than minor disturbance but less than financial damage), consistent with similar 'High service effort' effects in retrieved data for Engine Block subsystem. Occurrence set to 4 reflecting occasional occurrence given preventive measures but assembly process and design issues remain moderately likely. Detection set to 4 since multiple functional and field validations exist, with moderately high likelihood of detection prior to customer impact. This balances measures effectiveness and aligns with retrieved context but adapts for the baseframe and Type 6 engine slightly more critical role."
Baseframe supporting loads beyond design scope due to auxiliary system changes or modifications,Premature wear or failure of baseframe attachment points or channels,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Overfunction – unexpected load support' for the 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem is closely related to failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' or 'Structural support fails' in 'Engine Block' subsystems in 'Gas Engine Type 4' from retrieved data. Both address structural support components under load, with similar functions and failure effects (premature wear or failure of baseframe attachment points or channels comparable to damage on interface components, lack of stiffness, loosening of bolts). Preventive measures involving design involvement, FEA, bolted joint calculations, and tolerance adherence are highly similar. Detective measures also overlap substantially (overload testing, endurance run inspections, bolted joint preload measurement, vibration and fluid monitoring). However, the target has 'overfunction' (unexpectedly higher load) while retrieved data is more about insufficient support, implying potentially higher severity from unexpected load but similar impact on structural integrity and components. Severity is set consistent with structural support damage ratings (8) as damage is significant but not regulatory violation or company-financial catastrophic. Occurrence is set slightly lower than assembly-related causes rated 5, since multiple preventive teams involved plus simulation efforts reduce likelihood of unforeseen load over design. Detection is aligned with multi-method testbench and inspection methods yielding detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection before delivery)."
Inadequate bolted joint design leading to insufficient clamping force and joint relaxation under thermal cycling,Distortion of engine block baseframe causing misalignment of connected engine components and impairment of overall engine assembly accuracy,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT. The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode 'Loss of dimensional stability' of the baseframe in the engine block, caused by 'Inadequate bolted joint design leading to insufficient clamping force and joint relaxation under thermal cycling'. The retrieved data does not contain this exact failure mode or failure effect for Gas Engine Type 6 or an exact/similar failure effect in the same functional context. Most retrieved data relates to sealing failures (leakage), insufficient structural support, or oil leakage issues in Gas Engine Type 4, which are different failure modes and failure effects in similar but not identical engine types and do not describe dimensional instability or misalignment. Given this, the rated failure effect is distortion causing misalignment and impaired assembly accuracy, which critically affects overall engine assembly, probably causing customer dissatisfaction and potential assembly line issues. Preventive and detective measures are strong and extensive for the bolted joint design and assembly process, including advanced calculations, simulations, measurement, and validation tests. This supports lowering occurrence and improving detection. 

Severity is rated high (8) due to loss of dimensional stability leading to measurable functional impairment and customer dissatisfaction, but not immediate regulatory violation or direct safety hazard.
Occurrence is rated moderate (4) given multiple strong preventive measures (VDI 2230 calculations, FEA simulations, ultrasonic inspections, tightening instructions) enhancing reliability and reducing the likelihood of insufficient clamping force under thermal cycling.
Detection is rated relatively good (3) since multiple validation and monitoring steps including functional testing, preload measurement, and assembly checks allow high likelihood of detecting failure causes before delivery.

Thus, ratings reflect a significant but mitigated risk scenario consistent with the given failure causes, effects, and controls in this specific system context."
High vibration levels amplified by inadequate damping and weak geometric tolerances causing cyclic loading,Cracking or fracture of baseframe structural elements leading to sudden loss of dimensional stability and engine block integrity,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Baseframe element) functionally aligns highly with the retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data involving the Engine Block subsystem structural components and vibration-related failure modes. The failure cause (high vibration + inadequate damping + weak geometric tolerances causing cyclic loading) and failure effect (cracking/fracture leading to loss of dimensional stability and engine block integrity) correlate strongly with failure modes like 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', and 'Structural support fails' documented in Gas Engine Type 4 Engine Block. The preventive and detective measures are closely matched or richer in the target system, indicating similar or better control. Severity ratings of 7-8 are attributed to fatigue and structural failure effects related to vibration, consistent with retrieved severity ratings for similar effects. Occurrence ratings for similar vibration-related causes and geometric tolerance issues are in the 3-5 range, reflecting occasional to low-frequency occurrences given strong preventive design and analysis measures. Detection ratings mostly range from 4 to 6 considering extensive testbench tests, endurance runs, assembly inspections, and vibration measurements available both in retrieved and target measures. Detection rating is adjusted to 5 to align with targeted inspections (e.g., FEA, bolted joint preload measurements) mixed with testbench and endurance run detection capability. Overall, the ratings leverage the retrieved data with slight adjustment for the slightly more critical failure effect (cracking and sudden failure of baseframe), justifying severity 8 and keeping occurrence and detection ratings consistent with proven similar context data."
V-room design deficiencies leading to inadequate thermal insulation,Higher gas temperature leading to engine knocking at the end cylinders (away from intake opening),"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in the 'V-room insulation' of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches exactly with a retrieved failure mode of the same name, subsystem, system element, function, failure cause, and failure effect in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines), same subsystem and system element, same failure mode, cause, and effect. The preventive and detective measures match exactly as well ('1d simulation', 'RAIP', 'FPQ (Quality control)', 'Drawing specification', 'FEA Simulation' for preventive; and various 'MCE Functional Testing' and 'Field Validation' measures for detection). Hence, the retrieved ratings are fully applicable to the target context without adjustment. Severity is consistent at 9 due to engine knocking which is a serious operational and regulatory risk. Occurrence is rated 5 considering the adequacy but not full elimination of design deficiencies despite the strong preventive methods. Detection at 2 reflects the robust MCE functional and field testing measures enabling certain detection before customer delivery. This is a typical example where mature design and testing procedures mitigate occurrence risk moderately and enable relatively certain detection, but the severity remains high due to critical downstream effects. Therefore, the existing retrieved ratings are adopted directly for the target FMEA assessment."
Design for maintenance inadequacies resulting in improper servicing and degradation,Combustion instability and higher thermal fluctuations,"EXACT_MATCH found with retrieved failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in 'V-room insulation' component of 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same subsystem and system element, with the same failure mode, cause, and failure effect. The retrieved ratings show occurrence 5 and detection 5 for cause 'Design for maintenance' with preventive measure 'Design guideline (maintainability)' and multiple extensive detective measures including validation plans and field inspections. Severity for combustion instability and thermal fluctuations is rated 9 given the high impact on combustion stability and regulatory implications. Since the target system is a similar gas engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) with the same subsystem and function and identical failure mode and cause, and preventive and detective measures align, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Casting tolerances of the crankcase causing dimensional deviations affecting insulation integrity,Increase in emission instability due to inconsistent gas temperature profiles,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (insulation of gas from heat of crankcase), failure mode ('Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture'), failure cause ('Casting tolerances of the crankcase'), and failure effect ('Increase in emission instability'). Preventive measures and detective measures in the retrieved context match the target system's existing measures ('RAIP', 'FPQ (Quality control)', 'Drawing specification', 'General design guidelines' for prevention; 'Validation plan for V-room', 'Assembly trial', 'MCE Performance measurement', 'Field validation', 'MCE Functional Testing' for detection). Given the high similarity in product category (Gas Engine family), subsystem, failure context, and measures, the risk ratings directly apply with no adjustment needed."
Transient engine operation conditions such as start-up and cool-down causing thermal stresses,Fluctuating gas temperatures causing combustion instability,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in 'V-room insulation', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Gas Engine Type 4' system, with directly matching failure mode, cause, effect, and very similar preventive and detective measures. The product difference (Type 6 vs Type 4) within same product category (Gas Engine) and identical functional context supports direct rating use. Severity evaluations are consistent with severe combustion instability risks, occurrence and detection ratings reflect moderate preventive and detective controls including validation plans and functional testing."
Combustion system characteristics inducing excessive temperatures near the V-room insulation,Higher gas temperature leading to engine knocking and combustion instability,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data matches the target system context very closely with the failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in the 'V-room insulation' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem, albeit in Gas Engine Type 4 rather than Type 6. The function, failure cause ('Combustion system characteristics inducing excessive temperatures near the V-room insulation'), and failure effect (higher gas temperature causing engine knocking and combustion instability) all correspond exactly. Preventive measures ('1d simulation', 'Requirement specification for combustion events', 'FEA Simulation') and detective measures ('Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing', 'Field Validation') also align exactly. The product category and subsystem remain the same, with the new product being a newer generation but similar gas engine type, so the ratings can be adapted with minor consideration for potential improved robustness in Type 6. Severity is 9 in Type 4 data due to the regulatory and financial impact of engine knocking and combustion instability, which holds for Type 6 as well. Occurrence is rated 5 reflecting occasional occurrence due to preventive measures in place but inherent combustion variability. Detection rating is 4 indicating high likelihood of detection in subsequent test plans and validations. Considering potentially improved engine design and controls in Type 6, the occurrence could be slightly lower, but given the fundamental combustion challenges remain, it is reasonable to keep it consistent. Thus, severity 9, occurrence 5, detection 4 is appropriate for Type 6 context as well."
V-room design,Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'V-room insulation', identical function, failure mode ('Mechanical failure of V-room'), failure cause ('V-room design') and failure effect ('Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage') as retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem. Preventive and detective measures are very similar if not identical. Given high similarity but a newer generation engine (Type 6 vs Type 4), I slightly adjust occurrence and detection to reflect possible improvements/stability in design and validation processes, while severity remains consistent as the failure effect impact on customer/end system remains unchanged. Severity is retained as 8 due to major damage potential. Occurrence is kept moderate at 4 (slightly better preventive measures or design maturity anticipated in newer engine variant compared to 5 in Type 4). Detection is slightly improved to 4 reflecting possible enhanced validation/testing protocols, but not perfect detection, consistent with existing controls. This analytical adaptation follows the provided rating definitions and consistency notes."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 which is a very close product category and subsystem (Engine Block), and the exact same system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode (Mechanical failure of V-room), failure cause (Casting tolerances (Crankcase)), and failure effect (Loose metal parts causing major damage) are matched exactly. The preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved data are identical to the target system context. However, the target is Gas Engine Type 6, a different variant/version but within the same product family and functional context. Given this high similarity but slightly different product variant, the retrieved risk ratings provide a very strong reference base. 

Severity rating of 8 aligns well as the failure effect causes major damage leading to likely reduced engine function with customer dissatisfaction but not directly a regulatory violation or catastrophic damage that would warrant a 9-10. The occurrence rating of 2 indicates unlikely failure cause occurrence due to the effective preventive measures (RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specifications, design guidelines), which matches the measures planned in the target system.

Detection rating of 5 implies failure cause detection is only through targeted inspection (Validation plan, Assembly trials, Performance and field validation) before customer delivery, consistent with the detective measures listed.

Therefore, no significant adjustment of ratings is necessary; slight consideration that Gas Engine Type 6 may have similar preventive/detective robustness as Type 4 supports using the same ratings. This approach ensures consistency and leverages strong expert data for accurate risk assessment."
Combustion system,Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are the same, supporting direct use of existing ratings. Severity of 8 reflects major damage risk and customer dissatisfaction but not regulatory violation or direct financial loss beyond dissatisfaction (consistent with rating definitions). Occurrence rated 5 (occasional) considering existing preventive measures (1d simulation, requirement specifications, FEA simulations) that reduce likelihood but do not eliminate it. Detection rated 5 due to reliance on targeted inspections and functional testing and field validation, matching existing detective measures."
Crankcase design,Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4 shares the exact same Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase), Failure Mode (Mechanical failure of V-room), Failure Cause (Crankcase design), and Failure Effect (Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage) as the target Gas Engine Type 6 system. Preventive and detective measures are identical as well. The only difference is the engine type generation/version (Type 4 vs Type 6) within the same product category (Gas Engines) and the same subsystem/functional context. This represents a similar context where ratings are highly transferable but may need slight validation for advances or changes in engine design or testing rigor. Given that preventive and detective measures are consistent, and the failure effect severity is very high (major damage, rated 8 in the reference), no major operational context differences justify changing the Severity rating. The occurrence rating (5) reflects occasional occurrence despite existing preventive measures which are comprehensive (simulation, RAIP, FPQ, FEA, specifications). Given these strong preventive controls but serious design-inherent risk, Occurrence rating matches well. Detection rating at 5 indicates detection only via targeted inspection (MCE Functional Testing, Validation plan, Field Validation), consistent with the complicated nature of detecting mechanical V-room failures before damage occurs. Considering no significant changes in measures or operational usage that would lower or raise ratings, the same ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are adopted directly for Gas Engine Type 6."
Design for manufacturing,Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation, mechanical failure mode due to design for manufacturing causing loose metal parts to enter combustion chamber/crankcase and cause major damage. The target is Gas Engine Type 6, but the product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect match exactly. Preventive and detective measures between retrieved and target system are the same. Hence, risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable with no adjustment needed."
Thermal mechanical degradation,Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode ('Mechanical failure of V-room'), failure cause ('Thermal mechanical degradation'), and failure effect ('Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage'). Preventive measures (FEA Simulation, CFD Simulation) and detective measures (Validation plan for V-room, MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation) are identical. Given this full match and identical context, no rating adaptation is necessary. The retrieved ratings (Severity=8, Occurrence=5, Detection=5) align well with the failure effect severity (major damage and customer dissatisfaction), moderate likelihood with good simulation-based prevention, and moderate detection through component and field validations."
Backfire due to none optimal engine operation,Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the failure mode 'Mechanical failure of V-room' with cause 'Backfire due to none optimal engine operation' and failure effect 'Loose metal parts get into combustion chamber or crankcase housing causing major damage', matching exactly in product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and with identical preventive and detective measures. Despite the different engine types (4 vs 6), the similarity of design and function within the same product category and subsystem justifies direct use of the retrieved ratings. Existing preventive measures ('RAIP', 'FPQ (Quality control)', 'Drawing specification', 'FEA Simulation') and detective measures ('Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection, backfire detection)', 'Field Validation (Component inspection, backfire detection)') are identical, indicating consistent risk control effectiveness. The severity rating of 8 reflects serious customer dissatisfaction due to major damage; occurrence of 5 denotes occasional failures considering preventive controls; detection rating of 5 indicates detection primarily through targeted inspections before customer delivery, aligned with testing plans."
V-room design,Higher gas temperature leading to engine knocking at the end cylinders (Away from intake opening (v-room entrance)),"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches retrieved data exactly for Product Category (Gas Engine series), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Allow Air/Gas/Mixture through crankcase), Failure Mode (Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture), Failure Cause (V-room design) and Failure Effect (Higher gas temperature leading to engine knocking at the end cylinders). The preventive and detective measures listed are also consistent with those in the retrieved data for similar failure mode and cause. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings are used directly without adjustment. Severity is 9 due to the serious impact (engine knocking, a critical engine damage risk and possibly regulatory implications). Occurrence is 5 considering preventive measures such as simulations and quality control reducing but not eliminating likelihood. Detection is 2 reflecting high likelihood of detection by thorough MCE Functional Testing and validation activities before customer delivery."
Material selection,Combustion instability,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in the 'V-room insulation' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data is from a very similar system: 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures listed are largely identical or highly similar. Given same product category (gas engines), same functional context, and matching failure details, exact ratings from the 'Gas Engine Type 4' can be used as a strong baseline. Minor adjustment is not needed due to system similarity and equivalent measures. Severity rating is 9 due to critical combustion instability and potential regulatory/financial impact. Occurrence is 5 reflecting occasional occurrence considering preventive measures like simulations and specifications. Detection is 4 reflecting a high likelihood of detection in functional and component-level testing and validations before customer impact. Thus, retention of Severity=9, Occurrence=5, and Detection=4 is justified."
Design for maintenance,Increase of emission instability,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar historical data for Gas Engine Types 4 and 6, same Subsystem (Engine Block), identical System Element (V-room insulation), Function (air/gas mixture flow/insulation), Failure Mode ('Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture'), Failure Cause ('Design for maintenance'), and Failure Effect ('Increase of emission instability'). The preventive measure ('Design guideline (maintainability)') and detective measures ('Validation plan for V-room', 'Field validation (Combustion monitoring)', 'Assembly trial', as well as multiple component and daily validations) fully overlap with retrieved data. Severity rating is consistent at 9 due to emission instability and regulatory impact. Occurrence rating is 5 (occasional) reflecting that design guideline mitigates but does not eliminate failure cause. Detection rating is 5, detection requires targeted inspections but is reasonably covered by field and component validations. Ratings align with given preventive/detective measures and target Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Higher gas temperature leading to engine knocking at the end cylinders (Away from intake opening (v-room entrance)),"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure scenario matches exactly the retrieved FMEA data for Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Allows air/gas mixture through crankcase), Failure Mode (Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture), Failure Cause (Casting tolerances (Crankcase)), and identical Preventive and Detective measures. The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' is directly applicable to 'Gas Engine Type 6' due to same product category, subsystem, element, and failure characteristics with consistent preventive and detective measures. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be used without adjustment. Severity rating of 9 reflects the serious impact of knocking caused by elevated gas temperature which violates engine performance regulations and risks damage. The occurrence rating of 2 reflects the effectiveness of strong preventive measures (RAIP, FPQ, drawing specs) in controlling casting tolerance issues. The detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection via current validation, assembly, and performance measurement plans before final delivery. These ratings fit well the existing controls and failure impact within this engine type context."
Combustion system,Increase of emission instability,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches exactly on subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (related to gas mixture flow/insulation), failure mode ('Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture'), failure cause ('Combustion system'), and failure effect ('Increase of emission instability'), but differs in product variant/type (Type 4 vs Type 6). Both are gas engines within the same product category and system context. Preventive and detective measures are identical or very similar, indicating comparable risk profiles. Severity rating (9) reflects high impact due to emission instability causing regulatory and financial risks, consistent with product impact expectations for gas engines. Occurrence rating (5) represents occasional failure cause despite current preventive measures including simulations and specifications, consistent with existing data. Detection rating (4) indicates high likelihood of detection through established functional testing and validation plans. Given the high degree of similarity in technical context and measures with only a minor difference in product variant, retained ratings are applicable without adjustment."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with a failure mode of 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'V-room design' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'V-room insulation' system element. Retrieved data shows a strongly matching failure mode, cause, and effect in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem and system element, and similar function ('Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head' vs 'Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase'). Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical and comprehensive in both contexts, indicating similar risk control maturity. The product category (gas engines), subsystem, system element, failure mode, cause, and effect are all highly aligned. Minor differences in engine model generation or exact function phrasing justify a SIMILAR_CONTEXT decision rather than EXACT_MATCH but still allow close rating adaptation.

Severity is consistent at 5, reflecting moderate process disturbance and problems for some customers without regulatory violations or high financial damage.

Occurrence is rated 5 in the retrieved data, indicating 'occasional occurrence' given the effectiveness of preventive measures (simulation, design inspection, quality control). The complexity and engineering challenges associated with transient operation and V-room design support this level.

Detection is rated 2 in the retrieved data, indicating almost certain detection by functional testing and validation plans prior to customer delivery. The robust set of repeated functional and field validation tests supports this rating.

Given the highly similar engineering context, preventive/detective measures, and failure effect impact, the same ratings are appropriate for Gas Engine Type 6 with minor confidence. No adjustment is necessary."
Material selection,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved FMEA data is for Gas Engine Type 4 (different product version but same product category - gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), same failure mode and failure cause (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation caused by Material selection), and same failure effect (Instability in combustion process). Preventive and detective measures are also matched with only minor variations in naming. Severity is consistent across both, rated 5 due to process disturbance affecting combustion stability but no regulatory or financial violation. Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting that preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate the issue. Detection is rated 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) because the extensive MCE Functional Testing and field validations provide robust detection capability. Since the target is Gas Engine Type 6 (a closely related but different product version), slight adjustments are not necessary as the failure scenario impact and controls do not differ materially. Therefore, the risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable with confidence in current measures' effectiveness."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element V-room insulation, with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation', caused by 'Design for maintenance', and effect 'Drop in engine performance'. The retrieved data provides exact matches for all criteria except the product version (Type 4 vs Type 6) but same product category (gas engines) and identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect. Preventive and detective measures are very similar and correspond closely ('Design guideline (maintainability)', 'Validation plan for V-room', etc.). Considering type 6 is likely similar in design and operational context to type 4 gas engines, the retrieved ratings can be adapted with confirmation that maintainability measures and validations are comparable. Severity aligns with moderate performance drop and no regulatory or critical safety impact, standard occurrence for design take on maintainability, and detection difficulty justifies detection rating. Therefore, the exact ratings from type 4 are applicable without modification."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is in the same product category (gas engines) and identical subsystem (Engine Block) and system element (V-room insulation) as retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation'), failure cause ('Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'), and failure effect ('Instability in combustion process') match exactly in technical nature and functional context, with the preventive and detective measures identical. The operational difference between Type 6 and Type 4 engines is assumed minimal for this failure mode, so no adjustment on severity or occurrence is needed. Detection rating is maintained as the detection methods and coverage appear same in effectiveness. Thus, the retrieved ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are valid and directly applicable here without modification."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element V-room insulation, with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation'. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem and system element, and an almost identical failure mode, cause, and effect with similar preventive and detective measures exist. The functional difference between Gas Engine Type 4 and Type 6 is likely minor regarding air/gas mixture flow and transient operation impact, both within the same product category (gas engines) and same subsystem context. Severity is rated 5 because 'Drop in engine performance' causing some customers to experience reduced performance but no regulatory or severe financial impact is consistent. Occurrence is rated 5 reflecting occasional occurrence under transient engine operation despite preventive requirements specification; same preventive measures apply with no significant difference in control. Detection rating is adapted to 4 given that the provided detective measures ('Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', etc.) match the retrieved context, rendering high likelihood of detection before customer impact. Therefore, the risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are fully applicable with no need for upward or downward adjustment."
Combustion system,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data comes from a very close system context: Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6, same Subsystem 'Engine Block', identical System Element 'V-room insulation', same Function (allowing air/gas/mixture flow to cylinder head/crankcase), identical Failure Mode and Failure Cause, and identical Failure Effect ('Instability in combustion process'). Preventive and detective measures are also matching. The main difference is the product version/type (Type 4 vs Type 6), which may have minor design improvements but the core functional and failure context is conserved. Therefore, retrieved ratings can be adapted with high confidence but should be confirmed to fit Type 6 potentially having slightly improved detection capabilities due to newer design or more mature validation. However, as no evidence suggests major measure changes, ratings remain the same."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system Gas Engine Type 6 is of the same product category (Gas Engine) and shares the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation) and very closely matched failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation'), failure cause (Crankcase design), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance') as found in Gas Engine Type 4 data. Preventive and detective measures in the target system align closely with those in retrieved data (Gas Engine Type 4). Minor product generation differences may slightly impact occurrence due to possible design maturity and refinement but not significantly to change the rating drastically. Severity is consistent due to identical failure effect and customer impact. Detection is consistent given similar validation and functional testing measures are applied. Occurrence is retained at 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting that preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate failure cause likelihood."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('V-room insulation'), function, failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder'), failure cause ('V-room design'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance') as several retrieved entries from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The preventive and detective measures in the target context are very similar or identical to those from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Thus, context and measures are highly comparable, belonging to the same product category (Gas Engine) and same functional context. Hence we adapt the retrieved ratings from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with reasoning: Severity rating is stable at 5, reflecting process disturbance and some customer problem but no regulatory or major financial damage. Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence) aligned with the effectiveness and extent of preventive measures such as robust simulations and quality control in design. Detection rating is 2 (certain detection) supported by extensive, multi-level performance and component inspections and field validations listed in both sets of detective measures. Minor differences in product type do not materially affect the risk ratings given similar operational principles and failure modes. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the similar 'Gas Engine Type 4' case apply suitably to 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the specified measures in place."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Material selection' affects 'Drop in engine performance' in the 'V-room insulation' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for exactly the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect show Severity=5, Occurrence=5, Detection=4 with identical preventive and detective measures. Given the strong alignment in functional context and very similar preventive/detection measures, the ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are fully applicable but slightly conservatively considered as Gas Engine Type 6 may have some incremental design improvements or stricter requirements. However, the preventive/detective measures match exactly, so no adjustment is made. Severity considers the impact on engine performance drop moderate but not regulatory violation or major customer dissatisfaction, hence 5 is appropriate. Occurrence at 5 represents occasional occurrence given material selection risk despite simulations and specs. Detection at 4 indicates high likelihood of detection during functional and component inspections before customer impact. Therefore, ratings are adopted directly from the similar context."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Design for maintenance' is closely related to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Both have identical preventive measures ('Design guideline (maintainability)') and very similar sets of detective measures. Although product types differ (Type 6 vs Type 4), both are from the same product category (Gas Engine) and share a similar functional context. Consequently, the retrieved ratings (Severity=5, Occurrence=5, Detection=5) provide a solid baseline. 

Given the slightly newer engine type, but same preventive/detective scope and same failure effect impact, the severity rating remains at 5 (moderate process disturbance/engine performance drop). Occurrence remains at 5, indicating occasional occurrence despite preventive design guidelines. Detection remains at 5 due to the comprehensive but targeted inspections and validations available, similar to the previous context.

Hence, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are adapted directly with no adjustments, confidently reflecting the current maintenance design and validation plans effectiveness in Type 6."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the target failure scenario is 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' in the 'V-room insulation' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved data with exact match context is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, preventive and detective measures. This is a strong similarity but different product version. Given both products belong to the same product category (gas engines), with nearly identical failure mode and measures, the severity rating remains unchanged as failure effect impact on engine performance is consistent (rated 5). Occurrence rating is kept low (2) reflecting effective preventive measures ('RAIP', 'FPQ', 'Drawing specification', 'General design guidelines'). Detection rating has two close values depending on failure mode wording: 5 for 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' (detection via targeted inspection and performance measurements) and 5 for similar failure modes; these are consistent with the detailed detective measures listed. Considering the slight difference in product type (Type 6 vs Type 4), environmental or operational context may not significantly affect occurrence or detection for this failure cause. Therefore, the original severity=5, occurrence=2, detection=5 ratings from the similar context are logically applicable without change."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieval data for Gas Engine Type 4 with same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder), failure cause (Transient engine operation - start up, cool down), and failure effect (Drop in engine performance). Preventive and detective measures closely match the target system. Gas Engine Type 6 is a very close product variant within the same product category (gas engines) and identical functional context, so direct use of retrieved ratings is appropriate. The severity rating 5 reflects moderate performance drop impacting some customers. Occurrence rating 5 reflects occasional failure likelihood despite preventive measure 'Requirement specification for combustion events'. Detection rating 4 corresponds to a high likelihood of detection in subsequent performance testing steps as per the listed detective measures. Therefore, extracted ratings are consistent and applicable without adjustment."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation element, with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Combustion system' leading to 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data shows an EXACT MATCH for Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect alongside the same preventive and detective measures. Thus, the core functional and failure context is effectively the same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem and element (Engine Block > V-room insulation), identical failure mode and failure cause, and very closely matching preventive/detective measures. Between Type 4 and Type 6 engines, differences might exist in engine size or tuning but gas flow and combustion systems fundamentals remain consistent. Severity relates to performance drop (rated 5), a mid-level impact reflecting process disturbance and problems for some customers, which firmly applies for any gas engine. Occurrence rated as 5 reflects occasional occurrence despite robust 1d and FEA simulations and specs—these measures reduce but do not eliminate failure cause 'Combustion system' issues. Detection rated as 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection by planned validation and MCE functional tests before customer impact. No significant context factors require adjusting these ratings downward or upward. Therefore, the retrieved ratings fit well the new target system context and will be used directly."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element V-room insulation, function allowing air/gas/mixture to cylinder head, failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', failure cause 'Crankcase design', and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved data contains exact matching failure modes, causes, effects, and preventive/detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 with nearly identical contexts. Given same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem, system element, and failure characteristics, the context is highly similar but not exact due to different engine type number. Preventive and detective measures are the same. Severity rating for this failure effect in retrieved data is consistently 5, reflecting 'process disturbance, problems for some customers', which is appropriate for drop in engine performance. Occurrence is 5 in retrieved data indicating occasional occurrence with the listed preventive measures. Detection rating is 4, representing high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes given the functional tests and validations. Since Gas Engine Type 6 might have slightly improved designs or updated measures but no explicit changes are mentioned, the retrieved ratings are applicable with no adjustment. Hence, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are adopted without change for target system."
V-room design,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' while the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines), the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), same function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), same failure mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder), same failure cause (V-room design), and same failure effect (Instability in combustion process). Preventive and detective measures are very similar or identical. Therefore, the existing ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 provide a highly relevant baseline. 

Rating Adjustment Reasoning:
- Severity (S=5) is consistent with process disturbances affecting some customers (combustion instability but not regulatory violation or severe damage). Same applies to Gas Engine Type 6.
- Occurrence (O=5) matches an occasional occurrence despite strong preventive measures (1d simulation, RAIP, FPQ, Drawing spec, FEA). Given Type 6 likely has comparable engineering rigor, the same occurrence rating is appropriate.
- Detection (D=2) in the retrieved context indicates a high probability of detection through extensive MCE Functional Testing and validation before delivery, matching the detective measures listed for the target system. This low detection rating is maintained, reflecting reliable detection capabilities.

No significant operational or environmental differences suggest adjusting ratings upward or downward. Hence, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable with confirmation based on preventive/detective measures consistency."
Design for maintenance,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, while the target is Gas Engine Type 6, both sharing the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The product category (gas engines) and functional context match closely, allowing reuse of risk ratings with minor consideration for possible context evolution or operational differences. Preventive and detective measures in the target system are essentially the same as those in the retrieved data, implying comparable effectiveness. Therefore, the retrieved ratings (Severity=5, Occurrence=5, Detection=5) are appropriate and directly applicable without adjustment. Severity rating of 5 corresponds to process disturbance and some customer problems (instability in combustion), occurrence rating of 5 reflects occasional occurrence despite design guidelines for maintainability, and detection rating of 5 indicates detection through targeted inspection measures listed."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Instability in combustion process,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'V-room insulation', same function, failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', same failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' and failure effect 'Instability in combustion process' with identical preventive and detective measures. The existing ratings Severity=5, Occurrence=2, Detection=5 are consistent with the failure effect impact and the effectiveness of existing preventive (RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specification, Design guidelines) and detective measures (Validation plan, Assembly trial, MCE performance, Field validation). Since the target product is Gas Engine Type 6, which is a close variant within the same product category and functional context as Gas Engine Type 4, the ratings are valid without adjustment."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, V-room insulation) and failure scenario (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder caused by transient engine operation leading to instability in combustion process) matches very closely with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 of the same product category and subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Naming and functional similarity is exact, with the only difference being the gas engine version (Type 6 vs Type 4). Preventive and detective measures are also aligned, which supports applying retrieved ratings. Given changed engine generation could slightly influence occurrence due to maturity or design improvements, but no contrary evidence or modified measures provided, no adjustment to ratings is warranted. Severity remains consistent with instability causing engine performance disturbance rated moderate (5). Occurrence is moderate (5) reflecting occasional events during transient operation despite preventive specifications. Detection rating is consistent with a moderate detection capability (4) due to validation plans and functional performance testing but no immediate detection in process. Overall, the use of exact/similar context ratings with no adaptation is justified for this FMEA failure mode and cause in the given system."
Combustion system,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Combustion system' in the 'V-room insulation' element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The retrieved data is primarily from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with an identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect with the same preventive and detective measures. Since the product differs (Type 6 vs Type 4) but the product category (gas engines), subsystem, measures, and failure characteristics are highly similar, the retrieved ratings are highly relevant and applicable with minimal adjustment. 

Severity is set at 5 reflecting process disturbance and problems for some customers due to combustion instability. This matches the retrieved data and aligns with the failure effect impact on engine operation.

Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence) acknowledging the preventive measures (1d simulation, requirement specifications, FEA simulation) moderately reduce but do not eliminate the risk. The preventive measures and operating contexts are analogous between Type 4 and Type 6, so no change is made.

Detection is rated 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent tests) due to the robust functional testing, validation plans and field inspections currently in place, consistent with retrieved data.

In conclusion, the risk ratings are directly transferrable from the similar context of Gas Engine Type 4 with validated similarities in measures and failure impact, only adapted to consider possible minor variations in the Type 6 environment but no rating change recommended."
Crankcase design,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and the retrieved data source (Gas Engine Type 4) share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder'), failure cause (Crankcase design), and failure effect (Instability in combustion process). Preventive and detective measures listed for both are highly consistent, including 1D simulation, RAIP, FPQ, Drawing and FEA specifications, O-ring specs for prevention, and multiple MCE and field validation functional testing methods for detection. The small product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) suggests similar operating and environmental conditions, so severity does not need adjustment. Preventive and detective measure effectiveness remains comparable, supporting the adoption of occurrence and detection values from Type 4."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem 'Engine Block', identical system element 'V-room insulation', identical function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures are highly similar and comprehensive in both contexts with slight possible improvements in the newer 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' is consistently rated severity 5, indicating moderate customer-impacting performance degradation. Preventive measures like simulation (1d, FEA), quality controls (RAIP, FPQ), and specifications match. Detective measures include multiple MCE Functional Testing and field validations, reflecting good detection capability. Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional) fits the design failure cause with current preventive controls. Detection rating of 2 reflects a high likelihood of certain detection via functional and component inspection before customer delivery. Given the close similarity, these ratings apply well to the new target system without adjustments."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT due to close match on Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), Failure Mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation), Failure Cause (Material selection), Failure Effect (Drop in engine performance) found in ""Gas Engine Type 4"" which differs from the target ""Gas Engine Type 6"". Preventive and detective measures are closely matched and similarly extensive, indicating similar risk control maturity. Slight product generation difference (Type 4 to Type 6) may not materially change failure impact or control effectiveness. Severity is consistent with moderate customer impact (process disturbance, engine performance drop) at 5. Occurrence rated 5 (occasional occurrence) aligns with measures applied and historical rating. Detection at 4 reflects high likelihood of detection through comprehensive functional and field validations. No evidence suggests rating changes for Type 6 context; hence ratings are adopted with confidence."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block Subsystem, V-room insulation, function: Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head, failure mode: Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation, failure cause: Casting tolerances (Crankcase), failure effect: Drop in engine performance) exactly matches a retrieved failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, all within the same product category and functional context. Although the product type differs in version number (Type 6 vs Type 4), the similarity in context and preventive/detective measures is strong and rating consistency is confirmed. Preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data largely overlap with those in the target context. The severity rating for the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' is consistently rated as 5, reflecting process disturbance and issues for some customers, appropriate for the engine performance drop described. The occurrence rating is 2 (Unlikely) considering the provided preventive measures (RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specification, General design guidelines, plus additional simulation and specifications in target), indicating low likelihood of failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'. The detection rating is 5 (Detection only through targeted inspection), consistent with the detective measures (validation plans, assembly trials, MCE tests, field validations) indicating detection is possible but not guaranteed prior to customer delivery. Hence, the retrieved ratings can be directly applied without adjustment."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' versus retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same product category (gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), same function, failure mode, failure cause ('Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)') and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). Preventive measures and detective measures are also highly similar if not identical. Thus, the core technical context and risk profiles of the failure mode are strongly comparable. 

Slight difference in engine types (Type 6 vs Type 4) might have minor performance or environmental variations but the effect and mitigation measures remain applicable. Customer impact (engine performance drop) keeps severity at a medium level (rating 5), consistent with the retrieved data. Occurrence is moderate (rating 5) due to the transient nature and partial preventive control via combustion event specification. Detection rating of 4 reflects relatively high likelihood of detection during functional testing and validation plans before delivery, as per existing detective measures.

Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings for the exact failure mode, failure cause and failure effect context in Gas Engine Type 4 are adopted with minor confidence, as the product similarity and FMEA conditions match under 'SIMILAR_CONTEXT' rules."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, and the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4. Both share the same product category (gas engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures are also very similar, indicating strong relevance. Differences in engine type might cause minor operational or environmental nuances but are not substantial enough to change risk ratings significantly. The retrieved ratings for Severity (5), Occurrence (5), and Detection (4) fit well with the described failure effect and existing measures in the target system and require no adjustment."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context corresponds to 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'Crankcase design' in the 'V-room insulation' element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 shows an EXACT match in subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect with closely aligned preventive and detective measures. Given that Gas Engine Type 6 is a subsequent or similar product generation within the same product category and functional context, the ratings from Type 4 are highly applicable. However, considering the advancement or possible minor design improvements in Type 6 (reasonable assumption for a higher model number), the occurrence rating might be slightly adjusted if measures are considered more effective or unchanged. Current preventive and detective measures for the target are identical or better specified, and the failure effect impact remains the same. Therefore, severity remains consistent at 5 (medium impact on engine performance), occurrence remains at 5 (occasional occurrence given preventive measures), and detection remains at 4 (high likelihood of detection through functional and field validation testing). No significant differences warrant rating changes beyond the direct use from retrieved data."
Material selection,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', while the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), failure mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation), failure cause (Material selection), and failure effect (Instability in combustion process). Preventive and detective measures are also closely matching between both contexts. Hence, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable with minimal adjustments. Given no evidence of major change in severity impact or effectiveness of preventive and detective measures between engine types 4 and 6, ratings remain consistent. Severity rating of 5 is appropriate (process disturbance and problems for some customers). Occurrence rating of 5 indicates an occasional occurrence despite existing comprehensive preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 reflects a high likelihood of detection through functional and component inspections before customer delivery. No higher or lower risk indications for engine type 6 detected from provided context. Thus, the retrieved ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are valid for Gas Engine Type 6 with confirmation from matching conditions and aligned measures."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in 'V-room insulation' (Engine Block subsystem). Retrieved context is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with exact matching subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Product category and functional context are identical (gas engines, engine block, V-room insulation). Preventive and detective measures are highly similar (same names and scope). Therefore, the retrieved ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are fully applicable. Minor adaptation for likely advanced Gas Engine Type 6 technology and validation capabilities suggests maintaining severity and detection ratings as is, recognizing that Type 6 may have slightly enhanced testing but not drastically different. Occurrence rating also remains applicable due to same preventive measure 'Requirement specification for combustion events' addressing transient operation. Hence, ratings are adopted with confirmation that severity is moderate (combustion instability causing process disturbance), occurrence is occasional considering engine transient operations complexity, and detection is via multiple functional and validation tests providing good likelihood of detection before customer impact."
Combustion system,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data corresponds to Gas Engine Type 4, whereas the target is Gas Engine Type 6, both within the same product category (gas engines) and identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode, failure cause (Combustion System), and failure effect (Instability in combustion process). Preventive and detective measures match exactly, implying similar control effectiveness. Since the product generation differs, slight variations in operating conditions and validation could exist, but not significantly affecting the risk ratings. Severity remains consistent due to identical failure effect impact. Occurrence remains as in retrieved data considering matching preventive measures. Detection aligns with existing functional and field validation testing. Therefore, risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable with no need for adjustment."
Crankcase design,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6) and the retrieved data are from a very close and similar product (Gas Engine Type 4), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), same function, identical failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation'), same failure cause ('Crankcase design'), and same failure effect ('Instability in combustion process'). Preventive and detective measures listed in the target context perfectly match the retrieved data, indicating direct applicability. However, since the retrieved ratings originate from Type 4 engine and the target is Type 6, slight adjustments need confirmation regarding any changes in design maturity or robustness of preventive or detective measures. Given the preventive measures are comprehensive simulations, quality control, and specification validations, and the detective measures include extensive functional and field validation tests, the ratings likely hold for Type 6 with minimal adjustment. Severity corresponds to moderate process disturbance affecting engine combustion stability — rated 5 in retrieved context. Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting the presence but mitigated risk of crankcase design issues by preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 reflects high likelihood of detection in subsequent functional and field testing. No changes deemed necessary as the system context, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and measures are highly similar and directly applicable. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are used directly for the target context under SIMILAR_CONTEXT with analytical confirmation of consistency and measure effectiveness."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly consistent and directly matching failure scenario retrieved from Gas Engine Type 4 to target Gas Engine Type 6 in the same product category and subsystem context. The failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' with cause 'Material selection' and effect 'Drop in engine performance' has exactly matching preventive and detective measures. Hence, the existing risk ratings can be directly applied. Severity rated as 5 appropriately reflects process disturbance and some customer impact (engine performance drop). Occurrence rating of 5 aligns with occasional occurrence due to material selection despite preventive controls. Detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection by comprehensive functional and field validation tests before customer delivery."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 matches the Product Category (Gas Engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), Failure Mode (Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder), Failure Cause (Design for maintenance), Failure Effect (Drop in engine performance), and existing preventive and detective measures are also matching exactly. Ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable without adjustment given the similar engine design context and identical preventive/detective controls."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar context: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same Product Category (gas engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), Failure Mode (Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder), Failure Cause (Casting tolerances - Crankcase), and Failure Effect (Drop in engine performance). Preventive and detective measures match closely, indicating comparable risk mitigation levels. Hence, the retrieved ratings can be directly applied with confirmation of consistency to the current measures."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar and near identical context from retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4. The subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (Allow Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head), failure mode (Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder), failure cause (Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)), failure effect (Drop in engine performance), preventive measures (Requirement specification for combustion events) and detective measures (Validation plan for V-room, MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement), MCE Performance Measurement) match exactly with the target Gas Engine Type 6 context. Both products are in the same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem and system element with equivalent functional roles and failure characteristics. Thus, the retrieved risk ratings for severity, occurrence and detection are directly applicable and consistent with the provided preventive and detective measures for the target system."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and retrieved data system (Gas Engine Type 4) are in the same product category (Gas Engines) and the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function ('Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head'), failure mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder'), failure cause ('Crankcase design'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance') all match exactly. Preventive and detective measures listed are also equivalent or highly similar. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are directly applicable without adjustments."
V-room insulation design inadequacy resulting in sealing inefficiency,Oil/gas/mixture leakage into environment causing contamination and loss of crankcase integrity,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for the failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage' in the 'V-room insulation' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. Despite the product difference (Type 4 vs Type 6), the product category (Gas Engines), system element (V-room insulation), function (sealing to lower crankcase), failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect match exactly. Preventive and detective measures are identical, supporting direct use of the retrieved risk ratings without adjustment."
Inappropriate material selection leading to chemical or thermal degradation of insulation material,Progressive oil/mixture leakage to environment reducing engine reliability and increasing emissions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loss of sealing function caused by material degradation' of V-room insulation in Gas Engine Type 6 shares strong commonality with the failure mode 'Mechanical failure of V-room' in Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem. Both relate to sealing degradation of the V-room insulation material leading to oil/mixture leakage and reliability issues with emissions. Preventive and detective measures (simulations, material testing, validation plans, functional and field testing) are highly similar. The severity impact is analogous as it causes environmental leakage and reliability degradation, consistent with retrieved severity ratings of 8 for consequential damage effects. However, given target mentions ‘progressive oil/mixture leakage’ reducing reliability and increasing emissions, a severity rating of 7 is appropriate (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction, and environmental impact below regulatory violation). Occurrence for chemical/thermal degradation cause is rated slightly higher (6) than some related causes in retrieved data (mostly 3-5), reflecting moderate likelihood due to chemical/thermal risks and despite multiple preventive measures. Detection rating of 5 is consistent with existing detection by targeted inspections and functional/field validations. Thus, adapted ratings reflecting slightly higher occurrence but severity and detection aligned with similar context are recommended."
Bolted joint design deficiencies or bolt loosening from vibration leading to compromised clamping force,Sealing compromise causing oil/mixture leakage and potential contamination of surrounding engine compartments,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with a failure mode 'Functional limitation due to improper bolted joint integrity' causing sealing compromise to lower crankcase by bolted joint design deficiencies or bolt loosening from vibration. The retrieved data shows very close similarity in product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (Sealing to lower crankcase), failure mode (Oil/Mixture leakage over time), and failure cause (Bolted joint design and bolt loosening from vibration). The retrieved ratings pertain mostly to 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' for 'Gas Engine Type 4', which is a close but not exact product variant and same failure cause mode. Preventive and detective measures are highly overlapping with those in the target system. Differences stem mainly from bolt loosening specifically highlighted in the target but also present as a cause in the retrieved data with lower occurrence and detection ratings. Severity in retrieved data for leakage effect is 10 due to environmental and regulatory impact, which aligns with oil/mixture leakage contamination. Occurrence for 'Bolted joint design' is rated 5 (occasional) and detection 5 (targeted inspection) for leakage, but for 'Bolt loosening from vibration' the occurrence is 3 (low likelihood) and detection 4 (high likelihood of detection). The target preventive and detective measures include advanced simulation and ultrasonic bolt measurement, consistent with the retrieved context. It is reasonable to keep severity at 10 as leakage contamination has critical impact, assign occurrence as 4 (occasionally occurs) reflecting effective but not perfect preventive measures (between retrieved 3 and 5), and assign detection as 4 (high likelihood of detection) given existing ultrasonic and functional testing measures for vibration related bolt loosening, which is better than general targeted inspection (5) but not certain (1-2). This calibrated rating respects the technical nuances of the target and referenced data and respects the rating consistency rules."
"O-Ring aging, thermal mechanical degradation, or chemical degradation affecting sealing performance",Gradual increase of oil/gas/mixture leakage resulting in environmental contamination and engine performance degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation element with a failure mode of functional fluctuation due to O-Ring aging and related degradation, causing gradual leakage of oil/gas/mixture. The retrieved data closely matches similar failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, and similar sealing function (sealing crankcase). Failure cause 'O-Ring aging' and its degradation over time with preventive and detective measures nearly identical (including 'Design acc. to specification', 'Involve supplier', 'Design life per maintenance schedule' for prevention and 'Leakage test', 'Endurance run', etc. for detection) indicate strong similarity. Severity ratings in these documents for environmental contamination and performance degradation effects range around 7 (environmental leakage) and 5 (performance pressure loss), consistent with the described effects. Occurrence ratings for O-Ring aging causes are typically 3 (low likelihood but occasional due to aging), matching existing preventive measures which are robust but aging cannot be fully eliminated. Detection ratings range 4-6 depending on failure mode specifics but commonly 4 in well-instrumented tests and inspections ('Leakage test', 'Endurance run inspection'). Given the very close match but slightly different engine type and localization (V-room insulation vs front/rear end covers), slight adaptation is prudent: severity aligned to 7 reflecting environmental contamination and customer dissatisfaction (oil/gas leakage and engine performance degradation), occurrence rated 3 consistent with established preventive controls and aging nature, and detection rated 4 reflecting high likelihood of detecting leakage in endurance runs and leakage tests before delivery. This is therefore a SIMILAR_CONTEXT with minor adjustments reflecting slightly different system elements but almost identical functional context and risk aspects."
Casting tolerances and crankcase dimensional variation causing misfit at sealing interface,Localized seal failure leading to compartment leakage and potential engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode is 'Functional interruption through misalignment affecting seal interface' caused by 'Casting tolerances and crankcase dimensional variation causing misfit at sealing interface' for V-room insulation sealing function in Gas Engine Type 6. While no exact records exist for this specific failure mode in Gas Engine Type 6, highly relevant data from Gas Engine Type 4 on 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in the V-room insulation sharing the same subsystem and system element provides aligned failure causes including 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' with preventive and detective measures very similar to those in the target context. The occurrence rating in the retrieved data for this cause is 2, reflecting strong preventive controls including RAIP, FPQ, drawing specifications, tolerances, FEA and modal clash checks, which match the target measures. The detection rating is 4, consistent with assembly trials and multiple performance and field validations also present in the target context. 

Severity for the failure effect 'Localized seal failure leading to compartment leakage and potential engine damage' is aligned with leakage failure modes in the engine block that typically lead to compartment leakage and engine damage; these effects are generally rated around 7-8 because they represent reduced service and potential dissatisfaction but typically no direct regulatory violations or severe financial loss expected at the seal interface level. Hence severity is assigned 7.

Occurrence rating is kept at 2 matching the reference due to strong preventive controls for managing casting tolerances.

Detection rating is maintained at 4 as testing and validation methods are robust but do not guarantee certain (1-2) detection before assembly or customer delivery.

This approach applies suitable adaptation of retrieved context risk ratings (SIMILAR_CONTEXT) reflecting highly comparable system element, failure cause, and preventive/detection measures with adjustment of severity based on the failure impact in the target Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Backfire or combustion irregularities causing pressure spikes affecting seal integrity,Sudden loss of sealing resulting in rapid oil/mixture leakage and possible engine downtime,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode involves 'Functional limitation due to non-optimal engine operation' caused by 'Backfire or combustion irregularities causing pressure spikes affecting seal integrity' in the 'V-room insulation' of a 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data primarily relates to 'Gas Engine Type 4', similar engine block subsystems, and closely related sealing and pressure-related failure modes (e.g., lack of sealing, leakage due to pressure issues). The function of sealing to lower crankcase and the failure effect of sudden loss of sealing with rapid oil/mixture leakage causing potential downtime implies a high severity effect compared to other moderate leakage or flow disturbance failure effects in retrieved data. Preventive and detective measures are robust and comparable in complexity and scope, including simulation, specification, and monitoring. However, the severity here is higher due to sudden and rapid leakage and possible engine downtime, compared to slower leakage observed in similar failure modes. Occurrence is expected to be moderate based on simulation/sensor-based preventative controls addressing combustion irregularities and backfire events. Detection is moderate-to-good due to multi-level functional testing and monitoring but still challenged by transient pressure spikes and field validation nuances. Thus, adapted ratings take severity higher than normal oil leakage (e.g., severity 4) and detection slightly worse due to transient nature, while occurrence reflects moderate likelihood despite strong preventive and detective measures."
"Incorrect assembly, design for maintenance faults, or improper O-Ring installation",Leakage from crankcase leading to contamination and emission issues,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loss of sealing due to assembly or maintenance errors' in the 'V-room insulation' of the 'Engine Block' in Gas Engine Type 6 is closely related to the retrieved failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' in 'V-room insulation' of Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category, same subsystem, same system element and sealing function). Both failure modes cause leakage leading to contamination and emission issues, representing high regulatory and environmental impact, indicating very high severity. The failure cause includes incorrect assembly, design for maintenance faults, and improper O-Ring installation, all of which are covered by preventive and detective measures listed and fairly similar to those in the retrieved context. Ratings from the retrieved context for similar leakage failure causes in V-room insulation are occurrence 5 and detection 5 considering the current preventive and detective measures. Given the target system is a newer Gas Engine Type 6, which likely has similar or slightly improved processes, we retain occurrence and detection ratings as in the retrieved context, as the preventive/detective measures listed are comprehensive but still leave moderate risk. Severity is set to maximum (10) since leakage involving emissions and contamination are regulatory- and financial-impact failures consistent with retrieved data. Therefore, severity = 10, occurrence = 5, detection = 5."
V-room design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH because the targeted failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage' with failure cause 'V-room design' and failure effect 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment' for the 'V-room insulation' system element and 'Sealing to upper crankcase' function in 'Gas Engine Type 6' subsystem 'Engine Block' matches exactly with retrieved data for the same system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Preventive and detective measures are essentially identical, indicating similar risk control effectiveness and detection capability. Consequently, the retrieved risk ratings can be used directly without adjustment."
Material selection,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, with failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage' on 'V-room insulation' sealing to upper crankcase caused by material selection, resulting in leakage to environment. Retrieved data with exact matches on V-room insulation, function sealing to upper crankcase, failure mode and cause are from Gas Engine Type 4, a closely related product category and subsystem context. Preventive measures and detective measures are effectively identical or very similar. Severity ratings for similar failure effects (oil/gas mixture leakage to environment) in Gas Engine Type 4 are consistently rated 10, reflecting serious regulatory violations and potential financial/environmental impact. Occurrence rating in Gas Engine Type 4 is 5 (occasional occurrence considering preventive measures such as simulations and specification controls). Detection rating is 2 (certain detection via validation and functional testing). Given the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and nearly identical preventive/detective measures, these ratings directly apply. Minor product type difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) does not affect failure impact or controls, so no adjustment needed. Therefore, direct application of Gas Engine Type 4 risk ratings is accurate and consistent with FMEA risk rating methodology."
Design for maintenance,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, V-room insulation, Function: Sealing to upper crankcase, Failure Mode: Oil/Mixture leakage, Failure Cause: Design for maintenance, Failure Effect: Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment) has an exact match in retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, preventive and detective measures. The severity rating is consistent at 10 due to environmental oil/gas mixture leakage being a high-impact, regulatory-violating failure. Preventive measure 'Design guideline (maintainability)' and detective measures including extensive validation plans and field validation suggest moderate occurrence (rated at 5, occasional occurrence). Detection rating of 2 indicates high certainty of failure detection before reaching customers due to comprehensive test procedures. Given the similarity in design and measures, and since the product type and functional context remain very close, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are directly applicable without adjustment."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element V-room insulation, function sealing to upper crankcase, failure mode Oil/Mixture leakage, caused by Casting tolerances (Crankcase), resulting in Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment. The retrieved data contains an exact match with Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem, same system element, identical function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect with the same preventive and detective measures. Given the high similarity in product category (Gas Engines), the core functional element, and same preventive and detective measures, the ratings can be applied directly. Severity is 10 due to leakage of oil/gas mixture to environment which is regulatory and financial critical. Occurrence is 2 reflecting relatively effective preventive measures like RAIP, FPQ, drawing specs, and guidelines. Detection rating of 2 reflects reliable detection via validation plan, assembly trial, and functional MCE testing capable of catching the failure before customer impact. Therefore, the exact-match retrieved ratings apply without adjustment."
Crankcase design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6' / Engine Block / V-room insulation / Sealing to upper crankcase / Oil/Mixture leakage caused by Crankcase design with the failure effect of 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment' matches exactly in function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect and similar preventive and detective measures with the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem, same system element, same failure mode and cause, and the preventive and detective measures are substantially identical. The retrieved Severity is 10, Occurrence 5, and Detection 2, which fits well given the high severity of environmental leakage, existing preventive measures reducing frequency to occasional and strong validation/daily inspection measures ensuring high detection probability before delivery. No context factors in 'Gas Engine Type 6' are presented that would significantly alter severity or likelihoods compared to 'Type 4'. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Bolted joint design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches precisely with the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in 'Engine Block' subsystem on 'V-room insulation' with the exact function 'Sealing to upper crankcase', failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage', failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and failure effect 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment'. The preventive measures and detective measures in the retrieved data are identical to the current measures ('VDI 2230 Bolted joint handcalculation', 'FEA Bolted joint simulation', 'Ultrasonic bolt measurement' for preventive and 'Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component and daily inspection)', 'Field validation (Component and daily inspection)' for detective). Given the strong similarity in product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, cause, and effect as well as identical controls, it is appropriate to directly adopt the retrieved risk ratings. Severity is consistently rated as 10 due to environmental leakage with regulatory and financial impact. Occurrence is rated 5 indicating occasional occurrence despite preventive controls which is consistent with the preventive methods' effectiveness. Detection is rated 5 considering the added field validation and functional testing which detects failures but not with high certainty before delivery. The target system is a Type 6 engine variant but given the similarity to Type 4 in all relevant aspects and no significant contextual differences affecting failure likelihood or detection, the exact ratings apply without adjustment."
O-Ring design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation, sealing to upper crankcase, failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage', failure cause 'O-Ring design', failure effect 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment') closely matches multiple retrieved failure analyses from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures strongly overlap with those in the retrieved data (O-Ring specification, calculation, requirement list; validation plans and MCE functional testing, including daily and field inspections). The product type (Gas Engine Type 6 vs. Type 4) is the same product category with a similar operational environment. Minor updates and design improvements from Type 4 to Type 6 could reduce occurrence slightly or maintain the same level but unlikely to worsen. Severity relates to leakage impacting environment and regulation, consistent at 10 in retrieved data. Detection ratings have mostly been 2 (certain detection through functional testing and validation) for immediate leakage modes with these measures. Occurrence was rated 2 due to strong preventive measures at O-Ring design. Given the similarity and available data, ratings can be adopted with slight confirmation that improvements in Type 6 offset any new risk, keeping the same ratings aligned with Type 4 data."
Design for assembly process (bolted joint),Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, V-room insulation, Sealing to upper crankcase, failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage' due to 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)' and effect 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment') matches exactly with retrieved entries from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, with same preventive and detective measures. The product category (gas engine), subsystem (engine block), system element (V-room insulation), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect match precisely with only a change in gas engine version type (Type 4 to Type 6), which is a minor variation within the same product family. Preventive measures ('Internal experience', 'Work instruction for assembly', 'TA Tightening torques') and detective measures ('Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component and daily inspection)', 'Field validation (Component and daily inspection)') are consistent with retrieved data. Given this, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 data are directly applicable, with severity rated at maximum 10 due to environmental leakage of oil/gas mixture which is critical, occurrence at 5 indicating occasional occurrence considering preventive controls, and detection at 5 reflecting that detection depends on extensive planned validation and inspection rather than being certain or immediate. The slight addition of 'Field validation (Component and daily inspection)' in detective measures leads to detection rating 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) rather than 2 or 4. Hence, the retrieved highest-confidence data with these measures and cause-result pair is used as is for the target system."
Intake pressure increase during load rejection,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data contains an exact match for Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation), Function (Sealing to upper crankcase), Failure Mode (Oil/Mixture leakage), Failure Cause (Intake pressure increase during load rejection), and Failure Effect (Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment) for Gas Engine Type 4, which is very similar to Gas Engine Type 6 in the same functional and system context. Preventive and detective measures match exactly ['RAIP', 'FPQ (Quality control)', 'Drawing specification'] and ['Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection, backfire detection)', 'Field Validation (Component inspection, backfire detection)'] respectively, so occurrence and detection ratings are fully applicable with no adjustment needed. Severity remains at 10, consistent with the high impact of oil/gas mixture leaking into environment with potential regulatory violation or severe financial impact. Occurrence rating of 5 reflects occasional occurrence despite preventive measures, and detection rating of 2 reflects high likelihood of detection in current validation and functional testing processes. Hence, use retrieved ratings directly due to exact match and aligned measures."
V-room design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data: The target failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' in 'V-room insulation', 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Gas Engine Type 6' system corresponds exactly with a retrieved scenario for 'Gas Engine Type 4' product in the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures listed match closely, indicating similar maturity and effectiveness of controls. Considering similarity in gas engine product category and functional context, the exact retrieved ratings are fully applicable without adjustment. Severity rating is consistently 10 due to regulation and environmental impact. Occurrence is rated 5 reflecting occasional occurrence despite preventive measures. Detection rating varies by failure mode pairing: 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' with 'V-room design' cause in retrieved data shows a detection rating of 5, reflecting detection only by targeted inspection, aligning with the robust but not certain field and functional tests currently in place. The target’s detective measures are very similar, so detection rating 5 is retained. Thus, all ratings are directly adopted from exact match context data."
Material selection,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4 with Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation, function 'Sealing to upper crankcase', failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', failure cause 'Material selection' and failure effect 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment'. Preventive and detective measures closely match the target system context. Severity rated as 10 due to environmental leakage causing regulatory and financial impact. Occurrence is 5 reflecting occasional occurrence with existing simulations and specifications. Detection is 5 indicating detection via targeted inspections including functional and field validation. Minor context difference in product type (Type 4 vs Type 6) does not necessitate rating adjustment as operational and design context is equivalent."
Design for maintenance,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on closely matching failure mode, cause, effect, preventive and detective measures for Gas Engine Type 4 and target Gas Engine Type 6 in the Engine Block's V-room insulation with function 'Sealing to upper crankcase'. Given the product category (Gas Engine), system element (V-room insulation), failure mode (Oil/Mixture leakage over time), failure cause (Design for maintenance), and failure effect (Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment) match precisely, with identical preventive and detective measures, extracted risk ratings from Type 4 context are valid. The severity rating is high (10) reflecting environmental and regulatory impact of oil/gas leakage. Occurrence rating is medium (5), indicating occasional failure cause frequency despite preventive design guidelines. Detection rating is moderate (5), representing detection possible only by targeted inspections prior to customer delivery but not fully guaranteed. No adjustment is needed because the system context and measures are essentially the same, only product iteration differing."
Crankcase design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (Sealing to upper crankcase), failure mode (Oil/Mixture leakage over time), failure cause (Crankcase design), and failure effect (Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment). Preventive and detective measures are identical, indicating similar efficacy. Ratings are directly applicable considering small product generation difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) with no indicated major design or context change that would alter severity or likelihood. Severity is rated maximum (10) due to environmental leakage and regulatory/financial impact. Occurrence is moderate (5) as preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate the risk. Detection is moderate (5), reflecting detection through targeted functional testing and field validation but no certain detection before customer impact."
Chemical degradation (all medias in contact with parts),Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved FMEA data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' on same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (Sealing to upper crankcase), failure mode (Oil/Mixture leakage over time), failure cause (Chemical degradation), and failure effect (Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment). Preventive and detective measures are identical between the target system and retrieved data. The product differs slightly (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4) but is in the same product category (gas engines) with the same functional context. Thus, risk ratings can be directly adopted. The severity is rated as 10 due to high impact (environmental leakage potentially causing regulation violation and financial damage). Occurrence is rated 6, reflecting an occasional likelihood moderated by well-defined preventive measures (fuel gas boundary conditions, material testing, supplier guidelines). Detection is rated 5, indicating detection primarily by targeted inspections (validation plans, functional testing, field validation). No adjustment needed as preventative/detective measures are the same, and the underlying risk profile remains consistent across engine generations."
Thermal mechanical degradation,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, V-room insulation, Sealing to upper crankcase, Failure Mode: Oil/Mixture leakage over time, Cause: Thermal mechanical degradation, Effect: Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment) matches exactly with retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, V-room insulation, Sealing to upper crankcase, same failure mode, cause and effect, with identical preventive and detective measures. Minor product model difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) is within the same product category and subsystem context. Preventive (FEA Simulation, CFD Simulation) and detective measures align perfectly. Severity corresponds to the critical environmental leakage with regulatory and financial impact (rated 10), occurrence reflects occasional failure cause despite measures (rated 5), and detection is moderate with targeted component and field testing (rated 5). Given this exact match and context consistency, the retrieved ratings are fully applicable without adjustment."
Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), and system element (V-room insulation) as the retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data. The failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' caused by 'Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation' and resulting in 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment' closely aligns functionally and physically with failure modes related to leakage and sealing issues of V-room insulation and crankcase components in Gas Engine Type 4. Although 'backfire' as a failure cause is not explicitly documented in the retrieved data, its effect is comparable to transient or combustion-related operation disturbances influencing sealing and leakage. Preventive measures and detective measures for the target are robust and comparable to those documented in Type 4. Given this similarity but nuance in failure cause, adaptation of severity, occurrence, and detection is required.

Severity: The failure effect is leakage of oil/gas/mixture to the environment, which corresponds to documented leakage failure effects with severity ratings of 4 (environmental leakage) up to 10 (gas in environment). Since leakage to environment with oil/gas mixture can be environmentally sensitive and could pose regulatory concerns depending on leakage amount, a severity of 7 is suitable—higher than typical oil leakage due to the presence of combustible gas mixture and potential customer dissatisfaction and partial regulatory impact, but not the highest severity which involves direct combustion instability or emissions failure.

Occurrence: 'Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation' is a transient combustion event analogous to failure causes such as 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' with occurrence ratings around 5 (occasional). Given the target’s preventive measures including simulation, specification, RAIP, FPQ, and design guidelines indicating good control but acknowledging complexity in combustion dynamics causing backfire, an occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence) is appropriate.

Detection: Detective measures in place include comprehensive validation plans and MCE functional testing at various levels including performance and component inspection, along with field validations and combustion monitoring. This correlates well with detection ratings of 2-4 in similar contexts related to V-room and combustion system detection of issues, typically indicating certain or high likelihood of detection before reaching the customer. Given the combination of active testing and field validation, detection rating of 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes but not certain) is appropriate, recognizing some uncertainty due to backfire timing and subtle leakage.

Overall, these adapted ratings reflect the similar severity and risk context with allowance for the specific failure cause of backfire in the target system."
Bolted joint design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with identical subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('V-room insulation'), function ('Sealing to upper crankcase'), failure mode ('Oil/Mixture leakage over time'), failure cause ('Bolted joint design'), and failure effect ('Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment'). Preventive and detective measures match closely, ensuring applicability. Severity rated at 10 due to environmental leakage with regulatory and financial impact. Occurrence rated at 5 (occasional occurrence), reflecting existing preventive measures (VDI 2230 handcalculation, FEA simulation, ultrasonic bolt measurement). Detection rated at 5, consistent with current detective measures (validation plans and MCE functional testing with daily inspections), indicating detection through targeted inspections before field failure. Minor differences in product version (Type 6 vs Type 4) have negligible impact due to same product category and similar engineering practices. Thus, ratings directly adopted from retrieved data without adjustment."
O-Ring design,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH - The queried failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' due to 'O-Ring design' causing 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment' on 'V-room insulation' sealing to upper crankcase in 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches two retrieved exact FMEAs from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. Both retrieved entries have Severity=10, Occurrence=2, Detection=5. Given similarity in engine design and subsystems within the same product category (Gas Engines) and same functional context, the existing risk ratings directly apply to the target system. No adaptations needed as preventive and detective measures match entirely."
Design for assembly process (bolted joint),Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target context matches exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), function (Sealing to upper crankcase), failure mode (Oil/Mixture leakage over time), failure cause (Design for assembly process - bolted joint), and failure effect (Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment). Preventive and detective measures are identical. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are fully applicable without modification."
Bolt loosening from vibration,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation system element, function sealing to upper crankcase, failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', failure cause 'Bolt loosening from vibration', failure effect 'Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment') exactly matches existing data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and preventive/detective measures. Although the product generation differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share the same functional and environmental context. Preventive measures (FEA Simulation, Bolted joint calculation) and detective measures (Validation plan for V-room, Ultrasonic bolt measurement, MCE Functional Testing vibration survey on bolt) are identical. Thus, the existing risk ratings (Severity=10, Occurrence=3, Detection=4) are directly applicable. Severity of 10 reflects violation of regulations and environmental impact due to oil/gas leakage. Occurrence at 3 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive engineering analysis and joint calculation. Detection at 4 reflects high likelihood of detecting bolt loosening in validation and ultrasonic inspection prior to customer delivery."
O-Ring aging,Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure scenario matches exactly with retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 regarding the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (V-room insulation), exact same function (Sealing to upper crankcase), same failure mode ('Oil/Mixture leakage over time'), same failure cause ('O-Ring aging'), and same failure effect ('Oil/Gas/Mixture leakage to environment'). The preventive measures overlap substantially (O-Ring specification, calculation, involvement of supplier, design to specification, tolerances, design life aligned with maintenance schedule) with a broader and more detailed set of detective measures in the target system, which encompass all retrieved detective measures plus additional ones. Severity is consistently rated as 10 due to environmental leakage causing potential regulatory and financial consequences. Occurrence rating of 2 in retrieved data reflects unlikely occurrence considering strong preventive measures; the target's preventive approach is at least equivalent, so 2 remains appropriate. Detection rating in retrieved data is 2 (certain detection in subsequent processes), whereas the target system has more extensive detective measures covering assembly, functional, endurance, and leakage tests, supporting at least the same or better detection capability. Therefore, detection rating of 2 is maintained. Consequently, given exact matching context and comparable or better preventive/detective controls, retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly errors leading to improper sealing or misalignment,Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' for 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause ('Assembly process / Design for assembly'), and failure effect (oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment). Preventive measures and detective methods are highly similar, including FPQ, drawing checks, assembly instructions, RAIP, sensor specifications, assembly trials, and functional testing. The retrieved data consistently shows a severity rating of 4 for oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment, occurrence rating of 5 for assembly process/design for assembly cause (reflecting occasional occurrence despite preventive measures), and detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes but not certain). The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) likely has comparable operating conditions and impact on customers. Given similarity in product category, system context, and measures, ratings are adapted directly without modification."
Crankcase design deficiencies affecting sealing interfaces and pressure boundaries,Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH based on direct retrieval of failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in 'CCV (blow-by) system' within 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' system, which closely matches the target context 'Gas Engine Type 6' with identical system element, function, failure mode, failure cause (crankcase design deficiencies), and failure effect. The existing preventive and detective measures align well with those described in the retrieved data. The severity rating of 4 is consistent with environmental contamination and efficiency loss described. Occurrence rating of 6 reflects occasional failures due to crankcase design despite preventive measures like O-Ring specification, design compliance, and Proof of Concept testing. Detection rating of 5 corresponds to detection via MCE Functional Testing and field validation measures, indicating detection possible but not certain before customer impact. Given the strong similarity in product category, system element, function, failure mode, cause, effect, and measures, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without modification."
CCV (blow-by) system design flaws causing insufficient sealing or material incompatibility,Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', while retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both are in the same product category (gas engines) and share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV (blow-by) system), function, failure mode ('Leakage of blow-by gas'), failure cause ('CCV (blow-by) system design flaws'), and failure effect ('Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment'). Therefore, this is a similar context scenario requiring adaptation of known ratings. The operational environment and preventive/detective measures are highly aligned, with identical measures listed, indicating comparable risk levels. The retrieved base ratings are Severity 4, Occurrence 3, Detection 2. The severity reflects environmental contamination and minor efficiency loss (rated 4 as process disturbance). Preventive measures such as FEA Simulation and sensor specifications effectively reduce occurrence to low likelihood (3). Detection measures (vibration measurement, functional testing, field validation, pressure monitoring) provide high likelihood of detection pre-customer impact (Detection 2). No additional contextual risk enhancement or mitigation factors justify modifying these ratings for Gas Engine Type 6; hence, ratings from Type 4 are directly applicable with a confirming rationale."
"Gasket and O-Ring design selection errors, wrong materials or dimensions",Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH with direct use of retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 CCV (blow-by) system failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' caused by 'Gasket & O-Ring design'. The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and retrieved system 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV system), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures are very similar if not the same, making risk ratings directly applicable. The severity is consistent as the failure causes oil/blow-by gas leakage causing environmental contamination and efficiency loss (severity rating 4). Occurrence is rated low (2) since preventive measures such as specification catalogues, calculation, and design to specification are in place. Detection is rated high likelihood of detection (2) because of multiple functional and field validation testing measures present. Hence, no rating adjustment is necessary."
"Maintenance neglect - insufficient oil, filter, or O-Ring replacement",Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH based on matching Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), Function (Direct blow-by gas from crankcase to gas mixer), Failure Mode ('Leakage of blow-by gas'), Failure Cause (Maintenance neglect - insufficient oil, filter, or O-Ring replacement), and Failure Effect ('Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency'). The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same CCV system and failure mode with the cause 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' shows occurrence and detection ratings consistent with the preventive measure 'Maintenance Plan and Instruction' and detective measures 'Crankcase pressure monitoring' and 'Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring' as per the target context. The failure effect severity is rated 4 indicating process disturbance/environmental contamination but not regulatory violation or severe financial impact. Hence, applying the exactly matched and well-documented ratings directly for the Type 6 engine is justified."
Material fatigue and degradation under prolonged cyclic loads and thermal stress,Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment causing environmental contamination and loss of system efficiency,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time (progressive sealing loss)' in the CCV (blow-by) system component of Gas Engine Type 6 closely matches the failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' in the CCV (blow-by) system of Gas Engine Type 4 in retrieved data. Both share the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV system), function (direct blow-by gas), failure mode (leakage over time), failure cause (material fatigue and degradation relating to sealing), and failure effect (oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment). Preventive and detective measures are consistent and extensive in both contexts, including assembly checks, FEA simulation, O-Ring design and maintenance, pressure monitoring, and functional testing. The retrieved severity rating for the failure effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' is 4, reflecting process disturbance with some customer impact but not regulatory or high financial damage. Occurrence ratings for relevant failure causes (O-Ring aging, crankcase design, CCV system design, piping design, assembly process) average around 3-6 based on preventive measures, with assembly process occurrence at 5 due to process variability. Detection ratings range from 2 to 5 depending on cause and detection measures, with highly effective MCE functional tests and field validation reducing detection risk. Given the excellent correlation of failure mode, cause, effects, and preventive/detective controls, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Oil type incompatibility and poor maintenance practices leading to excessive oil entrainment,Decreased blow-by filtering efficiency causing potential engine contamination and increased emissions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' with the failure cause 'Oil type incompatibility and poor maintenance practices leading to excessive oil entrainment' is directly matched in the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', Engine Block, CCV system with very similar failure mode, cause, effect, and preventive/detective measures. Both contexts share the product category (Gas Engines), subsystem, system element, function, and failure mode with consistent preventive and detective controls such as supplier recommendations, oil analysis, maintenance plans, CFD analysis, and endurance tests. The severity rating for the failure effect 'Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency causing potential engine contamination and increased emissions' is given as 4 in the existing data, consistent with process disturbance and partial impact on customers. The occurrence rating for the failure cause related to oil type and maintenance is 2 based on effective preventive controls. The detection rating is 5 due to reliance on targeted inspections (endurance runs and oil quality tests). Since the target system is an evolved version of the Gas Engine and the failure cause and effects, as well as preventive/detective measures, are highly aligned, these ratings are valid with no need for rating adjustment. Minor differences in engine generation and possible operating environments do not significantly change the risk profile given similar measures and failure impacts."
Thermal boundary conditions causing oil vaporization and carryover into blow-by gas,Decreased blow-by filtering efficiency causing potential engine contamination and increased emissions,"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' with failure cause 'Thermal boundary conditions causing oil vaporization and carryover into blow-by gas' and failure effect 'Decreased blow-by filtering efficiency causing potential engine contamination and increased emissions' corresponds directly to the documented failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' of 'Gas Engine Type 4', Engine Block subsystem. The failure cause 'Thermal boundary conditions' matches, and preventive/detective measures align closely. Severity rating of 4 is consistent for the described failure effect (process/customer disturbance). The occurrence rating is 4 according to preventive measures like Cylinder liner design, FEA, CFD, and oil guidelines. Detection rating is 5 reflecting detection only by targeted inspections like endurance runs, thermal surveys, and oil/blow-by functional tests. Hence, exact retrieved data applies without change due to high context similarity and matching measures."
Position of blow-by extraction point causing higher oil entrainment,Decreased blow-by filtering efficiency causing potential engine contamination and increased emissions,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, CCV (blow-by) system) and failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' caused by 'Position of blow-by extraction point' matches precisely with the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem and system element, same failure mode, cause, and effect with aligned preventive and detective measures. The preventive measures (CFD Analysis, Benchmark of other engines, Bolted joint analysis, DP 46 Crankcase ventilation system, FEA of blow-by system / crankcase interface) and detective measures (Blow-by system functional test, Endurance run, Field validation) match completely. Severity rating for the failure effect 'Decreased blow-by filtering efficiency' is consistently documented as 4 (process disturbance, problems for some customers), occurrence is 6 (occasional occurrence) reflecting that position related design issues are somewhat common though controlled, and detection is 3 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) due to functional testing and inspections in place. Thus, using these established ratings is appropriate and consistent."
Design for vibration issues leading to displacement or deformation of flow path components,High crankcase pressure buildup causing increased stress on seals and potential leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) has a highly analogous subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV blow-by system), function (direct blow-by gas to gas mixer), failure mode (blocking of gas flow path), failure cause (design for vibration leading to displacement/deformation), and failure effect (high crankcase pressure buildup) compared to retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4. Preventive measures ('FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System') and detective measures ('MCE Vibration and modal test (CCV System)', 'Field Validation (Vibration monitoring)') exactly match those in the retrieved context for the failure cause 'Design for vibration'. Hence occurrence and detection ratings can be carried over directly as 3 and 4 respectively. The severity rating for 'High crankcase pressure' is consistently rated as 4 in the retrieved data, which fits the target failure effect describing increased stress on seals and potential leakage, causing process disturbance but no direct regulatory or financial violation. Therefore we keep severity rating at 4. Minor adjustments are unnecessary because system function, environment, and measures are analogous between type 4 and type 6 gas engines, supporting a consistent risk rating application."
Assembly process errors causing blockage or partial obstruction in gas flow,High crankcase pressure buildup causing increased stress on seals and potential leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' in the CCV (blow-by) system of the Engine Block subsystem caused by assembly process errors leading to blockage or partial obstruction. The retrieved data includes a highly similar failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' occurring in the Gas Engine Type 4 with matching subsystem, system element, and failure mode/cause/effect. Preventive and detective measures are closely comparable (FPQ, Drawing & 3D Model Check, Assembly Instructions, RAIP, Sensor specification; Assembly Trial, Commissioning Checklist, MCE Functional Testing). The severity effect is described as 'High pressure in Crankcase' with a severity rating of 4, which fits the described effect of increased crankcase pressure and potential leakage from elevated crankcase pressure leading to stress on seals. Preventive measures suggest moderate occurrence (rated 5) consistent with assembly errors as occasional but controlled failures. Detection via Assembly Trial, Commissioning Checklist and MCE Functional Testing gives a detection rating of 4, indicating a high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes before customer delivery. Given minor contextual differences (Gas Engine Type 6 vs. Type 4), more advanced or similar design and process controls are expected, so ratings are accepted with slight contextual confidence without adjustment. Thus, final risk ratings are aligned with the retrieved similar context ratings reflecting current preventive and detective measures accurately."
CCV (blow-by) system design causing insufficient flow clearance or poor routing,High crankcase pressure buildup causing increased stress on seals and potential leakage,"EXACT_MATCH due to highly similar context: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, component CCV (blow-by) system, with the failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' caused by 'CCV (blow-by) system design' and effect of high crankcase pressure resulting in increased seal stress or leakage. Retrieved FMEA data shows the exact same failure mode, cause, subsystem, and system element in Gas Engine Type 4, which differs only by engine type/version within the same product category and subsystem context. Preventive and detective measures are essentially the same, indicating consistent preventive/detection control effectiveness. Severity is reported as 4 for 'High pressure in Crankcase', occurrence is 3 considering existing preventive measures, and detection is 2 due to effective multi-parameter monitoring (vibration, pressure, functional tests). Therefore, ratings can be directly adopted with strong confidence for the target system."
Intake system (gas mixer) design issues causing back pressure increase,"Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment, reducing system integrity and causing emissions","EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data contains failure modes with exact matches to the target system context: the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), component (CCV (blow-by) system), function (directs blow-by gas from crankcase to gas mixer), failure mode (pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages), failure cause (intake system/gas mixer design issues causing back pressure), and failure effect (oil/blow-by gas leakage to the environment). The preventive and detective measures also match (GASENGDP022 Air and gas intake, Design verification of air and gas intake for prevention; MCE Functional Testing (CCV System), Crankcase pressure monitoring, Blow-By Filter differential pressure monitoring for detection). Thus, we adopt the retrieved ratings directly without adjustment."
Sensor monitoring failure causing inability to detect and regulate system pressure,"Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment, reducing system integrity and causing emissions","EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved vector data: The failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakage' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' of 'Engine Block' subsystem is found in Gas Engine Type 4 context, which matches core elements and functional context with the target Gas Engine Type 6 scenario (same product category 'Gas Engines', identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause 'Sensor monitoring (function)', and failure effect). Preventive measures ('Sensor specification') and detective measures ('Vibration testing (sensor installation)', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring') are identical. Severity rating for associated failure effect 'Oil/Blow-by gas leakage to environment' is consistently rated 4, indicating process disturbance with problems for some customers. Occurrence for sensor monitoring failure cause is rated 3 indicating low likelihood with preventive measure in place. Detection rating is 2 indicating a high likelihood of detection via existing detective measures. Thus, retrieved risk ratings apply directly without adjustment."
Crankcase design not meeting pressure limits or sealing requirements,"Oil/blow-by gas leakage to environment, reducing system integrity and causing emissions","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakage' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related in system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect to documented failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4', specifically failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' and closely related variants within the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Although the gas engine types differ (Type 6 vs Type 4), both share the same product category (gas engines), similar subsystem and system element contexts, and identical failure cause 'Crankcase design' with the same preventive and detective measures. Thus, the ratings from Type 4 can be adapted with minor contextual considerations for Type 6. Preventive measures (O-Ring and sealing specification, GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System, Proof of Concept Test) and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation, Crankcase pressure monitoring) exactly match those used in the referenced data. The impact, leakage of oil/blow-by gas to the environment causing emissions and reduced system integrity, corresponds to a minor but noticeable process disturbance for some customers, consistent with a severity rating of 4. Occurrence is rated higher (6) due to crankcase design complexity and remaining moderate risk even after preventive measures, as evident in similar existing data. Detection capability is moderate (5), aligned with functional and field testing but no perfect early-stage detection, consistent with documented detection ratings for this cause and failure mode combination in Type 4. Therefore, ratings are taken from the similar existing context, fully justified by matching system element, failure cause, failure mode, and preventive/detective measures with careful reasoning that the environment and customer impact remain consistent across engine types within the same product category."
Vibration-induced fatigue due to insufficient design or material strength,CCV assembly or parts breakage leading to system malfunction or leakage,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV (blow-by) system), function (providing structural support), failure mode ('Structural support fails') and failure cause (vibration-induced fatigue / design insufficiency). Retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' CCV system structural support failure shows Severity = 7, Occurrence = 3 (for design/vibration related causes), Detection = 4 considering current robust preventive (FEA, simulation, QA) and detective measures (vibration tests, monitoring, functional testing). Since the provided target measures closely match retrieved ones and the functional criticality is similar, the ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Assembly process faults causing weak joints or misalignment,CCV assembly or parts breakage leading to system malfunction or leakage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Structural support fails' in the CCV (blow-by) system of 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block closely matches failure modes 'Lack of structure for support' and 'Insufficient structural support' from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same product category and subsystem context. Both share the same system element (CCV system), function (providing structural support / installation space), failure cause (assembly process faults causing weak joints or misalignment), and failure effect (structural failure resulting in malfunction or potential breakage). Although the Gas Engine Type 6 might have some design/process changes, preventive and detective measures are very similar, focusing on assembly quality control, instructions, RAIP, and functional testing. Severity in retrieved data for structural support failures ranges 4 (sensor failure) to 8 (damage to interface components, lack of stiffness). The failure effect in this target is breakage leading to system malfunction or leakage, which is more severe than sensor failure but not as catastrophic as oil leakage or environmental hazard scenarios. Based on this and given the CCV system's criticality and expected customer impact (system malfunction or leakage), a severity rating of 7 (reduced service, customer dissatisfaction) is most appropriate. Occurrence is rated at 5 consistent with assembly process faults with similar preventive controls and multiple quality checkpoints (FPQ, RAIP, instructions, sensor specs) indicating moderate risk but not frequent failure. Detection rating is adapted to 4 reflecting high likelihood of detection during assembly trials, commissioning, and functional tests before customer delivery, consistent with similar failure causes and detective measures in Gas Engine Type 4 data. Therefore, ratings are adjusted from retrieved data trends to fit the slightly more critical failure effect context but well-controlled occurrence and strong detection measures."
"Transient engine operation (startup, cooldown) causing mechanical stresses",CCV assembly or parts breakage leading to system malfunction or leakage,"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'Structural support fails' with the cause 'Transient engine operation (startup, cooldown)' leading to 'CCV assembly or parts breakage' exactly matches failure mode, cause, subsystem, system element, function, and product category context retrieved in the data from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6 (both gas engines, same CCV system in engine block). Preventive and detective measures listed for the failure cause match closely with the target system context measures. Therefore, risk ratings can be used directly with verification of severity consistency and adjustment of detection if needed. Severity is consistently rated 7 because breakage causing system malfunction or leakage leads to customer dissatisfaction and degraded function but no regulatory violation or catastrophic financial damage. Occurrence rating is 5 reflecting occasional occurrence despite effective preventive measures (FEA simulation, modal analysis, etc.). Detection rating is 2 in retrieved data (high likelihood of detection through vibration tests, functional testing and field inspection), whereas target context lists extensive detective measures supporting high detectability before customer impact. Thus, detection rating of 2 is retained."
Design for vibration restricting maintenance access or causing damage,High service effort leading to longer maintenance times and increased downtime,"EXACT_MATCH found with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' in 'CCV (blow-by) system' within 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4. The target is Gas Engine Type 6 CCV system, same subsystem and system element with identical function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect related to serviceability impacted by vibration design and maintenance access. Preventive (FEA Simulation, GASENGDP046) and detective measures (MCE Vibration/modal test, Field Validation) exactly align. Severity rating of 5 (high service effort, longer maintenance times increasing downtime) is consistent with impact definition. Occurrence rating of 3 reflects occasional occurrence considering effective preventive measures for vibration/design. Detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection via vibration testing and field validation before customer impact. Therefore, ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 context apply directly without modification."
Assembly and design for assembly issues reducing maintainability,High service effort leading to longer maintenance times and increased downtime,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' in the CCV (blow-by) system caused by 'Assembly and design for assembly issues', resulting in 'High service effort'. Retrieved data provides detailed FMEA ratings for a very similar failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV system), same failure mode, failure cause and failure effect, but in an earlier engine type. The preventive and detective measures are also nearly identical. Therefore, this constitutes a similar context with a slight difference in engine type generation. Given that Type 6 is likely a more advanced or updated product, some improvements in assembly and testing might occur, potentially leading to slightly better (lower) occurrence and detection ratings. The severity remains consistent as the failure effect impact on service effort is similar and unchanged in nature. Hence severity rating is retained at 5 (process disturbance/problems for some customers). Occurrence rating is adapted slightly lower from 5 (occasional occurrence) to 4 due to likely incremental design and process improvements in the newer Type 6 engine. Detection rating remains at 4 reflecting the presence of effective but not totally certain detection via assembly trials, commissioning checklists, and functional testing. This balances the established detection effectiveness with realistic limitations. Ratings therefore are Severity = 5, Occurrence = 4, Detection = 4."
Sensor monitoring (function),Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data corresponds exactly to the same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), function (Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system), failure mode (System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages), failure cause (Sensor monitoring (function)), and failure effect (Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment) in a Gas Engine Type 4 product, while the target is Gas Engine Type 6. Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) with identical functional context and measures (sensor specification for prevention, vibration testing and crankcase pressure monitoring for detection). Given the similarity, the retrieved ratings for Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable as a baseline. Considering that Type 6 gas engines are likely similar or improved in technology and monitoring capability compared to Type 4, and existing preventive and detective measures remain the same, minor downward adjustment for occurrence or detection is not justified due to identical measures. Severity remains the same as failure effect impact on system/environment does not change by product type. Detection rating remains low (2) due to effective vibration and pressure monitoring means. Occurrence remains low (3) as the sensor specification is a robust preventive measure. Therefore, the exact retrieved ratings for Type 4 are directly applied without adjustment."
Crankcase design,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'CCV (blow-by) system', same function 'Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system', same failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages', same failure cause 'Crankcase design' and failure effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' matches closely to the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both have identical preventive measures ['O-Ring and sealing specification', 'GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System', 'Proof of Concept Test'] and detective measures ['MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)', 'Field Validation (Crankcase & Blow-by filter pressure monitoring)', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring']. The same failure effect severity is rated 4 in the retrieved data, consistent with a moderate process disturbance and some customer problems, which fits the failure effect description well and remains consistent across similar gas engine platforms. Occurrence rating is 6 in retrieved data, reflecting occasional occurrence given the existing preventive measures which are significant but cannot eliminate the failure cause completely. Detection rating is 5, representing detection only through targeted inspection like functional and field validation tests, consistent with existing detective measures. Given the very close alignment in product category, subsystem, system element, failure mode, cause, effects and measures, it is justifiable to adopt the retrieved ratings for the new engine variant without substantial adjustment, as the core technical and operational context and mitigation effectiveness remain equivalent. Therefore, ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 context are appropriate to apply directly to Gas Engine Type 6, categorized as SIMILAR_CONTEXT with confirmation reasoning based on preventive/detective measures and failure impact similarities."
CCV (blow-by) system design,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data matches the failure mode ('System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages'), failure cause ('CCV (blow-by) system design'), failure effect ('Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment'), subsystem ('Engine Block'), and system element ('CCV (blow-by) system'). The only difference is the product variant: target product is 'Gas Engine Type 6' vs retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share very similar functional and subsystem contexts. Preventive and detective measures for the failure cause are identical, indicating similar risk controls. Given this, the existing risk ratings from the 'Gas Engine Type 4' context are valid but should be reviewed for slight adaptation if any significant design or environment changes between engine types exist. However, no such differences impacting risk likelihood or detection are indicated. Severity should remain at 4 since the failure effect impacts the environment with oil/blow-by gas leakage causing process disturbance but no regulations violation or severe financial damage. Occurrence remains 3 reflecting low likelihood due to effective preventive measures like FEA simulation, system guidelines, and sensor specs. Detection remains 2 because multiple effective detective methods are in place (vibration measurement, functional & field validation, pressure monitoring) ensuring high likelihood of early detection before customer impact. Therefore, use the retrieved ratings directly with confirmation that measures are in place and effective for the target system context."
Power unit,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match in all key elements except for the product version (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6). The subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV system), function, failure mode, failure cause (Power unit), failure effect (Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment), and applied preventive and detective measures are identical or closely equivalent. Both engine types are from the same product category (Gas Engines) and have very similar functional and environmental contexts. Therefore, we can leverage the known risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 and adjust minimally if needed. Given the matching preventive measures ('GASENGDP007 Power Unit', 'Design verification of power unit') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring', 'Blow-By Filter differential pressure monitoring'), and no evidence of changed reliability or detection capabilities in Type 6, we keep Severity at 4 (process disturbance, problems for some customers). Occurrence remains at 6 (occasional occurrence) reflecting moderate likelihood given preventive measures. Detection is kept at 5 (detection only through targeted inspection), consistent with existing functional tests and monitoring approaches. No new data suggests stricter or more lenient ratings. Hence, adaptation is minimal and justified through direct context equivalence and equivalent control effectiveness."
Turbocharger,Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data references the Gas Engine Type 4 system, Engine Block subsystem, same system element CCV (blow-by) system with identical failure mode, failure cause (Turbocharger), failure effect (Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment), and identical preventive and detective measures. The target Gas Engine Type 6 is a newer or variant platform but within the same product category (Gas Engine) and functional context. The risk factors are highly similar, with no indication of significant differences in severity or measures effectiveness for this failure scenario. Hence, the existing ratings can be used. No major adjustments are justified due to the slightly newer product version or minute contextual differences. Severity (S=4) indicates a moderate process disturbance and problems for some customers. Occurrence (O=3) reflects a low likelihood due to effective preventive controls such as 'GASENGDP031 Gas Engine Turbocharging' and 'Turbocharger specification'. Detection (D=4) indicates a high likelihood of detection with current detective measures like 'MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)' and 'Crankcase pressure monitoring'. These are consistent across multiple retrieved failure mode entries with the same causes and effects."
Oil loading in filters,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' system exactly matches the failure mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), failure cause ('Oil loading in filters'), and failure effect ('Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)') for the same system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Preventive and detective measures are highly similar or identical, with the same monitoring strategies and maintenance plans applied. Since the product differs only by type/version (Type 4 vs Type 6) but belongs to the same product category (gas engines) and functional context, the failure impact and controls are comparable. Therefore, the existing ratings (Severity: 6, Occurrence: 5, Detection: 4) are fully appropriate for the target context without adjustment, reflecting moderate process disturbance potentially affecting some customers (severity 6), occasional failure cause occurrence despite existing preventive measures (occurrence 5), and high likelihood of detection before customer impact due to pressure monitoring (detection 4)."
Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.),Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and retrieved data system (Gas Engine Type 4) belong to the same product category (Gas Engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), and share the identical failure mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), failure cause ('Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.)'), and failure effect ('Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)'). The preventive and detective measures are practically the same. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 are highly applicable. Minor adjustments are considered for any type/model improvements or evolutions typical from Type 4 to Type 6. Since there is no indication of major change in preventive/detective effectiveness, the original ratings are retained without modification: Severity 6 (process disturbance / some customer issues due to excess oil in compressor), Occurrence 5 (occasional occurrence despite maintenance plan and design), and Detection 2 (highly likely detection via MCE functional testing and pressure monitoring)."
Crankcase design,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches closely with retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' product, 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'CCV (blow-by) system' element, same failure mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), failure cause ('Crankcase design'), and failure effect ('Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)'). Preventive and detective measures are also identical between the target and retrieved data. Hence, the existing ratings can be used directly. Severity is consistent at 6 since this indicates a process disturbance and some customer problems due to excessive oil in the turbocharger. Occurrence is 6, reflecting occasional occurrence despite effective preventive measures. Detection rating of 5 indicates detection only by targeted inspection (functional testing, field validation, pressure monitoring). All ratings are in line with the current state of measures and failure context."
CCV (blow-by) system design,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and retrieved data (Gas Engine Type 4) belong to the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV (blow-by) system), failure mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), failure cause ('CCV (blow-by) system design'), and failure effect ('Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)'). Although the exact engine type differs, the functional context and failure characteristics are highly analogous. Preventive and detective measures match closely, suggesting comparable risk profiles. Minor potential differences in engine design maturity or operational parameters between Type 4 and Type 6 are not explicitly indicated, so no adjustment to ratings beyond the retrieved data is warranted. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are suitable to be applied to the target context."
Design for vibration,CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6) closely matches the retrieved data context (Gas Engine Type 4) with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV (blow-by) system), function (prevent pressure exceedance in system), failure mode (Structural support fails), failure cause (Design for vibration), and failure effect (CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine). Both preventive and detective measures are highly aligned, e.g., FEA Simulation, GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System, modal and vibration analyses, monitoring, and commissioning checklists. The product category, engineering domain, and functional context are similar enough to apply the retrieved ratings without adjustment. Verified that preventive and detective measures in the target match those in the retrieved context confirms the consistency of occurrence and detection ratings. Severity of 7 corresponds well to structural failure causing customer dissatisfaction and reduced service in the engine block. Therefore, the exact retrieved ratings are used confidently for the target context."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' involves the same subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('CCV (blow-by) system'), the failure mode ('Structural support fails'), the failure cause ('Assembly process / Design for assembly'), and the failure effect ('CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine'). The function differs slightly in wording but aligns in purpose (structural support role). The product is a different gas engine type (Type 6 vs Type 4) but within the same product category and with similar application environments. Preventive and detective measures are consistent and comparable. Hence, it's appropriate to adapt the existing risk ratings with minor consideration for potential moderate improvements or changes in design or process maturity in the newer engine model. Across Type 4 data, Severity is rated as 7, Occurrence as 5, Detection as 4, reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction (broken assembly impacting engine), occasional occurrence with existing preventive controls, and fairly good detection capability before customer delivery via assembly trial and commissioning. No major changes in preventive/detection measures are noted. Given that Type 6 gas engine likely maintains similar criticality and controls, the same ratings are applicable. Therefore, Severity=7, Occurrence=5, Detection=4 are recommended."
CCV (blow-by) system design,CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6 within the Engine Block subsystem for the CCV (blow-by) system. The failure mode 'Structural support fails' caused by 'CCV (blow-by) system design' causing 'CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine' matches exactly in failure mode, cause, effect, and subsystem context with consistent preventive and detective measures. Slight product variation (Type 4 to Type 6 gas engine) typically does not affect core structural support severity or risk profile given similar design standards, function, and measures. Therefore, retrieved ratings (Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=2) are directly applicable without adjustment."
Piping design,CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV blow-by system), identical failure mode ('Structural support fails'), identical failure cause ('Piping design'), and identical failure effect (CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine). Preventive and detective measures listed in the target context match exactly those in the retrieved data, indicating equivalent controls and detection capabilities. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be directly adopted from this highly analogous context without adjustment."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine,"EXACT_MATCH with verification and consistency checks. The target failure mode, cause, and effect match exactly with the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block', 'CCV (blow-by) system', 'Structural support fails', caused by 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)', with the same failure effect 'CCV assembly or parts breakage from engine'. Preventive and detective measures are identical or very similar, implying similar risk profiles. Severity is consistent at 7 due to significant customer dissatisfaction from part breakage. Occurrence is 5, reflecting an occasional occurrence given transient engine operational stresses despite comprehensive preventive measures including FEA Simulation and modal analysis. Detection rating of 2 indicates high confidence in early detection via vibration and pressure monitoring, functional testing, and field inspections. Thus, the existing ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Design for vibration,High service effort,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), same function (not exceed specific pressure difference in system aligns with providing installation space for sensors/cable routing which relates directly to serviceability and pressure control), same failure mode (Poor serviceability), same failure cause (Design for vibration), and same failure effect (High service effort). Preventive and detective measures are identical ['FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System'] and ['MCE Vibration and modal test (CCV System)', 'Field Validation (Vibration monitoring)']. Ratings found were Severity=5, Occurrence=3, Detection=4, which correctly reflect moderate severity (process disturbance/service effort), low likelihood due to strong preventive actions, and high likelihood of detection. Hence, these retrieved risk ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,High service effort,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, CCV (blow-by) system, Function: Not exceed a specific pressure difference) closely matches retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, failure mode (Poor serviceability), failure cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly), and failure effect (High service effort). Preventive and detective measures are also the same. Function differs slightly (target is pressure difference control; retrieved references are installation space for sensors or cables), but this difference minimally impacts severity as the failure effect remains 'High service effort' in both contexts, indicating similar customer/system-level impact. Preventive and detective measures effectiveness are consistent between contexts. Therefore, occurrence and detection ratings from retrieved data are applicable without adjustment. Severity is aligned with impact on service effort (rated 5)."
CCV (blow-by) system design,High service effort,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), same function ('Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system' is close in functional scope to related CCV system pressure control functions), same failure mode (Poor serviceability), same failure cause (CCV (blow-by) system design), and same failure effect (High service effort). Preventive and detective measures align closely between retrieved and target contexts. Small evolution in product type (Type 4 to Type 6) does not materially affect customer impact or measures' effectiveness. Therefore, retrieved rating for severity=5, occurrence=3, detection=2 is directly applicable and consistent with the given measures."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),High service effort,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode 'Poor serviceability', failure cause 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)', and failure effect 'High service effort'. Preventive and detective measures are the same. Although the target product is Type 6 and retrieved data from Type 4, both belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) with functionally equivalent contexts, so close equivalence in ratings is valid. The existing maintenance plan and pressure monitoring measures are consistent, supporting using the retrieved risk ratings directly without adjustment."
Inadequate CCV (blow-by) system design resulting in poor sealing or structural weakness,Oil loss to environment and decreased oil return efficiency causing potential engine lubrication issues,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4's CCV (blow-by) system with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV), function (Direct oil back to the crankcase), failure mode (Oil leakage to environment), failure cause (CCV system design), and failure effect (Oil leakage to environment causing lubrication issues). Although the target is Gas Engine Type 6, it is the same product category and highly similar functional and subsystem context. The preventive and detective measures listed are nearly identical to those in the retrieved data, confirming the applicability of these ratings without major adjustment. Severity is consistently rated at 4 due to oil loss impacting some customers/processes (no regulatory violation or major financial damage). Occurrence is rated 3 reflecting low likelihood due to solid preventive design measures (FEA Simulation, guidelines, sensor specs). Detection is rated 2, indicating high certainty of detection through current functional testing, vibration measurement, and field monitoring methods."
Oil loading in filters causing clogging and reduced oil flow through the CCV system,Insufficient oil drainage back to the crankcase resulting in excessive oil carryover to turbocharger or blow-by gases,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), Function (Direct oil back to the crankcase), Failure Mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), Failure Cause ('Oil loading in filters causing clogging and reduced oil flow through the CCV system') and Failure Effect ('Insufficient oil drainage back to the crankcase resulting in excessive oil carryover to turbocharger or blow-by gases'). The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 exactly matches the requested context except for a minor product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) within the same product category and subsystem context, justifying direct reuse of the ratings. Preventive and detective measures listed in the target context mirror those from the retrieved data. Hence, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the retrieved data are fully applicable without adjustment."
Oil deposit buildup (residue on filter mesh and elements) reducing filter permeability,Oil flow restriction leading to improper oil return and increased oil consumption or engine damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The target failure mode 'Too little oil draining over time due to oil deposit buildup reducing filter permeability' in the CCV (blow-by) system of Gas Engine Type 6 shares high similarity in system element, subsystem, and failure cause with documented failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4, specifically 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' and 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter over time' caused by 'Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.)'. Preventive (Maintenance Plan regarding filter/pre-separator and design per GASENDP046) and detective measures (MCE functional testing, blow-by filter pressure monitoring, field validation, crankcase pressure monitoring) match closely. The operational function affects the oil return and can cause increased oil consumption or engine damage, implying a higher severity than just flow path disturbance resulting in crankcase pressure increase (severity 4). This effect is more severe because inadequate oil return can cause engine damage, thus consistent with severity 8 (major engine damage potential, customer dissatisfaction/reduced service). The occurrence rating from the prior context is 5 (occasional) based on the presence of similar preventive measures and history, which fits our preventive measures and known oil deposit issues over time. Detection is strong due to multiple in-line monitoring and field validation, rated 2 (certain detection in processes). Hence, severity is elevated compared to flow path clogging alone, occurrence maintained at documented rating, detection rating kept low due to effective monitoring. Adjustments are consistent with system similarity and measured measures."
Crankcase design issues causing inadequate pressure differential for oil return,Reduced oil return causing oil pooling in CCV system and higher oil concentrations in blow-by gas,"EXACT_MATCH with rationale: An exact match is found in retrieved data for the same Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV blow-by system), Function (Directs oil back to crankcase), Failure Mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), and Failure Cause ('Crankcase design causing inadequate pressure differential for oil return'). The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data match the given existing measures. The severity rating is consistent with the failure effect of reduced oil return causing oil pooling and higher oil concentrations in blow-by gas, leading to the related effect of 'Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)', rated severity 6. Occurrence and detection ratings in retrieved data are occurrence=6 and detection=5, reflecting the moderate likelihood due to crankcase design issues despite preventive measures, and detection requiring functional testing and field validation. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are appropriate and applied directly."
Piping design constraints causing flow restrictions or kinks impeding oil return,Reduced oil return flow rate with potential for system oil starvation or blow-by gas contamination,"EXACT_MATCH due to equivalent product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV (blow-by) system), function (Directs oil back to crankcase), failure mode ('Too little oil draining over time'), failure cause ('Piping design constraints causing flow restrictions or kinks'), and similar failure effect (Reduced oil return flow causing oil starvation/blow-by gas contamination) matching retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 to target Gas Engine Type 6. Preventive measures ('FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP048 Piping') and detective measures (vibration/modal tests, functional testing, pressure monitoring) are identical or equivalent in scope and effectiveness. Severity is aligned with failure effects causing moderate process disturbances risking component/system lubrication (consistent with severity 6). Occurrence and detection ratings match given the similar preventive and detective controls applied to piping design issues in this failure mode context. Therefore, retrieved ratings for this exact context are directly applicable without adjustment."
Incorrect position of blow-by extraction causing excessive oil entrainment in blow-by gases,Reduced blow-by filtering efficiency and increased oil carryover to intake or environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' caused by 'Incorrect position of blow-by extraction' on the 'CCV (blow-by) system' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem matches very closely a retrieved failure scenario in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same system element, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, all within the same product category and functional context. The preventive and detective measures listed are also very similar, including CFD analysis, benchmark, bolted joint analysis, DP 46 Crankcase ventilation system, FEA, and functional testing. As such, this is not an exact match due to the engine type difference (Type 6 vs Type 4), but strongly similar context. Risk ratings from the retrieved data are: Severity = 4 for 'Decrease of blow-by filtering efficiency' indicating moderate customer/process impact; Occurrence = 6 indicated for 'Position of blow-by extraction' cause, reflecting occasional occurrence despite existing preventive measures; Detection = 3 indicating high likelihood of detection through functional testing and validation measures. These ratings align well with the current preventive/detective controls noted for the target system. Minor context adjustment is not needed given similar complexity and mission profile between engine versions and no significant difference in operational impact or measures. Therefore, the ratings are adopted from the retrieved data with confirmation that severity (4) properly reflects a filtering efficiency decrease and occurrence (6) matches occasional failure despite good preventive controls. Detection rating (3) matches functional test inspections and field validations that effectively detect the cause before customer impact."
Thermal boundary conditions causing oil viscosity changes and oil mist formation,Increased oil content in blow-by gases reducing system efficacy and increasing pollution,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' in Gas Engine Type 6 CCV system closely matches documented failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV system), with identical function and failure effect. The existing preventive measures ('Design practice 18 - Cylinder liner', 'FEA', 'CFD', 'Oil operating guideline') and detective measures ('Endurance run', 'Field validation', 'Thermal survey', 'Oil functional test', 'Blow-by functional test') align closely with those in Gas Engine Type 4 for the failure cause 'Thermal boundary conditions' of this failure mode. Retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 shows occurrence rating of 4 and detection rating of 5 for this failure cause. Severity is aligned with the failure effect 'Increase of oil content in blow-by gases reducing efficacy and pollution', rated severity 4 in similar documented data, consistent with impact on process disturbance and environmental compliance. Considering the target system is a newer engine type (Type 6), potentially improved designs could reduce occurrence slightly but given thermal boundary conditions still challenging, occurrence is maintained at 4. Detection remains at 5 since detection relies on targeted inspections (functional and thermal tests) rather than certain process or inline measures. Severity is consistent with effect rating of 4 for reduced blow-by filtering efficiency and increased pollution, not causing direct regulation violation but customer process impact."
Oil type and maintenance issues leading to degraded oil properties increasing oil mist generation,Excessive oil in blow-by gas causing filter overload and possible engine contamination,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' of the 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches the retrieved failure mode data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same Product Category (Gas Engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV), and failure cause ('Oil type and maintenance'). Preventive and detective measures are highly similar and comparable in scope and approach (supplier recommendations, oil analysis, maintenance plans, endurance and functional tests). Therefore, the occurrence and detection ratings from Type 4 are applicable with minor verification. The severity rating must be evaluated based on failure effect. Retrieved data shows related failure effects from excess oil concentration leading to filter overload and engine contamination with severity ratings in range 4-6 for similar effects. Considering the function 'Direct oil back to the crankcase', the effect of excessive oil mist causing filter overload and possible engine contamination likely leads to customer-impacting issues but no direct regulation violation or severe financial penalty as primary effect. Therefore, severity rating is consistent with 6 (process disturbance, problems for some customers) as similar failure effects in Type 4 have severity 4 to 6. Occurrence rating is 2 (unlikely) reflecting effective preventive measures such as oil analysis and supplier recommendations. Detection rating is 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) since detection relies on endurance runs and oil functional tests, not always immediately apparent. Ratings are consistent and credible given similarity and validated context."
O-ring aging causing loss of sealing integrity,Gradual oil leak reducing oil return efficiency and environmental contamination,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment over time' due to 'O-ring aging causing loss of sealing integrity' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' of Gas Engine Type 6 engine block is very closely aligned to failure modes in the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, involving 'Degradation of sealing over time' or 'Oil leakage over time' related to O-ring aging and sealing loss. The product category (gas engines) and subsystem (engine block, CCV/blow-by system or similar sealing systems) are consistent. The failure cause (O-ring aging) and consequence (oil leakage, environmental contamination, reduced efficiency) also match well. 

Retrieved failure modes show occurrence ratings for 'O-ring aging' mostly around 2-3 considering preventive measures involving supplier involvement, design, tolerances, and maintenance schedules, and detection ratings between 4 and 6 depending on tests such as leakage tests and endurance runs. Severity for oil leak into environment effects in related cases is rated typically at 7, reflecting customer dissatisfaction and environmental contamination but no direct regulatory violation or catastrophic safety impact. The target failure mode severity aligns best with severity 7 ('Reduced service, customers dissatisfied' including environmental contamination).

Preventive and detective measures in target system are directly comparable or better (including leakage test, endurance runs, assembly tests, FPQ parts validation, and MCE testbench functional tests), so occurrence and detection ratings align or slightly improve. However, since aging is gradual and detective tests sometimes require targeted inspections, a detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) is appropriate rather than lower.

Therefore, adapted ratings from the similar failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 are used, adjusted considering the well-covered preventive and detective measures that the target system possesses.

RATING DECISIONS:
- Severity: 7 (matches oil leak to environment with environmental contamination and service reduction)
- Occurrence: 3 (aligned with O-ring aging cause given current preventive measures and typical aging risks)
- Detection: 4 (high likelihood of detection through leakage, endurance, and assembly tests but not certain)

This provides a coherent rating consistent with the rating definitions and retrieved similar cases."
Inadequate maintenance including oil and filter levels leading to seal wear and leakage,Progressive oil leakage and increased risk of system breakdown or environmental impact,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode of 'Oil leakage to environment over time' in the CCV (blow-by) system. Retrieved data shows very similar failure modes and causes in Gas Engine Type 4 for 'Oil leakage over time' and 'Degradation of sealing over time' occurring in similar components (Crankcase, CCV system) with matching preventive and detective measures. The failure cause 'Inadequate maintenance including oil and filter levels leading to seal wear and leakage' closely matches the failure cause 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' and 'O-ring aging' or 'Sealant/Gasket aging' from existing FMEA data. Preventive maintenance plans and crankcase & filter pressure monitoring are common detective measures in both contexts. Severity for leakage to environment effects in similar cases ranges around 4 (moderate environmental oil leakage) to 7 (environmental impact and system pressure loss). Considering that the failure effect includes progressive oil leakage and increased risk of system breakdown or environmental impact, and the impact on regulations/financial damage is moderate but notable, I assess Severity as 7 (reduced service, customers dissatisfied, plus environmental risks). Occurrence for maintenance-related causes with maintenance plan enforced rates as low (2) consistent with Type 4 data. Detection with crankcase and filter pressure monitoring aligns with rating 4 (high likelihood of detection in processes before major failure). Thus, adaptation yields Severity=7, Occurrence=2, and Detection=4."
"['Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'O-Ring aging', 'Crankcase design', 'CCV (blow-by) system design', 'Piping design', 'Gasket & O-Ring design', 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)']",Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6 with the failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' in the CCV (blow-by) system of the Engine Block subsystem, having failure causes and preventive/detective measures closely matching those in retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 with nearly identical failure modes, causes, and effects. Both systems belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem context, with consistent functional roles and failure effects ('Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment') assigned severity rating 4 in retrieved data. Preventive and detective measures are comparable. Therefore, it's appropriate to adapt the retrieved ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 to the Type 6 engine, taking into account the similarity of preventive/detective measures and the nature of the failure mode. No significant environmental or operational differences are indicated that would justify a change in occurrence or detection ratings. Severity remains 4, occurrence ratings range from 2 to 6 depending on cause prevalence, and detection ratings range 2-5 based on detection method efficacy per cause. This approach ensures consistent, technically justified ratings for the target context."
"['Intake system (Gas mixer)', 'Sensor monitoring (function)', 'Crankcase design', 'CCV (blow-by) system design', 'Power unit', 'Turbocharger']",Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' and failure effect 'Oil/Blow-By Gas leakage to environment' occurs in the CCV system of Gas Engine Type 6, which is functionally and structurally very similar to the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem and system element with the same failure mode and effect. The slight product variation from Type 4 to Type 6 in the same gas engine product category and subsystem context does not materially affect failure cause likelihoods or detection capabilities when considering the identical preventive and detective measures. Therefore, the retrieved ratings from Type 4 can be adapted directly with confidence. The failure effect severity remains consistent at 4 because leakage impacts remain process disturbances with some customer problems but no regulatory or high financial damage implications. Occurrence ratings tied to failure cause and preventive measures remain as given (varying between 3 and 6 based on cause, indicating low to occasional occurrence). Detection ratings are consistent with the effective existing detection methods which provide either high or certain detection before customer impact for most causes. Hence, no major adjustment is necessary beyond confirming rating applicability to the Type 6 context."
Air humidity leading to condensation within the CCV system filter,Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, CCV system) closely matches multiple retrieved failure mode records from Gas Engine Type 4 for the identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV system), function (Prevent condensation to oil), failure mode (Condensation forming in filter over time), failure cause (Air humidity leading to condensation in filter), and failure effect (Reduced oil life due to water contamination). Although the exact engine type differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category (gas engine), subsystem, component, function, and failure characteristics are effectively equivalent, with the same preventive measure ('GASENGDP-046 Crankcase Ventilation System, TA1100 - 0110') and detective measure ('Field Validation through filter pressure monitoring'). Given the strong alignment and analogous operational context, it is appropriate to adapt the retrieved ratings directly with minimal adjustment. Considering the same preventive and detective controls, the existing occurrence and detection ratings remain valid. The severity rating is consistent with the failure effect impact, which causes oil degradation but no direct regulatory breach or critical engine failure, placing it in the mid severity range. Hence, the recommended ratings are: Severity=5 (moderate process disturbance, some impact on customers), Occurrence=4 (occasional occurrence due to environmental humidity), Detection=5 (detection only through targeted inspections like field validation and pressure monitoring). This rating set aligns with the original data and fits the target context with expert validation."
Insufficient design considerations for maintenance leading to ineffective moisture removal,Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, CCV (blow-by) system in Engine Block subsystem with failure mode 'Condensation forming in filter over time' caused by 'Insufficient design considerations for maintenance'. Retrieved data shows an exact failure mode and cause match for Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect except in a different (older) engine type. The product category, subsystem context, and functional context remain consistent with only a difference in engine model version, which is a typical minor variation expected in similar systems. Preventive measures ('GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System', 'Maintenance plan and instruction') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing', 'Field Validation', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring', 'Blow-By Filter differential pressure monitoring') align well with those listed in retrieved data for the cause 'Design for maintenance'. Therefore, retrieved ratings are applicable with no need for adjustment for this similar context."
Suboptimal piping design causing cold spots where condensation forms,Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' CCV (blow-by) system failure mode 'Condensation forming in filter over time' caused by 'Suboptimal piping design causing cold spots' matches closely with retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' CCV system, same subsystem, same failure mode, cause, and effect. Naming and product type variations are minor, with same product category and function. Armed with direct data for 'Piping design' cause in this failure mode with existing preventive (FEA Simulation, piping guideline) and detective measures (multi-faceted vibration and pressure monitoring) that align well, the retrieved Occurrence=3 and Detection=4 are directly applicable with little adjustment. Severity rating is consistent for the failure effect 'Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination)' at 5. Therefore, we adopt the retrieved ratings without change."
Failing Gasket & O-Ring design causing leakage or moisture ingress,Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Condensation forming in filter over time' with failure cause 'Gasket & O-Ring design' and failure effect 'Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination)' perfectly matches a failure mode, cause, and effect in a similar product context (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6) within the same product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive measures and detective measures are also identical or very similar, indicating equivalent controls. Since the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 and the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, minor adaptation is needed to confirm ratings remain valid in potentially slightly different operational or design environments. Given the similarity in product family, identical preventive and detective measures, and the technical equivalence of the failure scenario, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without modification. Severity is consistent at 5 (process disturbance and problems for some customers due to oil life reduction), Occurrence is low at 2 considering the robust preventive measures catalog and established gasket/O-ring specifications, and Detection is high at 2 due to effective MCE Functional Testing and Field Validation measures, enabling almost certain detection prior to customer impact."
Insufficient insulation design allowing temperature drops that promote condensation,Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination),"EXACT_MATCH: The failure mode 'Condensation forming in filter over time' with failure cause 'Insufficient insulation design allowing temperature drops that promote condensation' and failure effect 'Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination)' exactly matches the retrieved failure mode data for 'Condensation forming in filter over time' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of the Gas Engine Type 4 system. The preventive and detective measures listed (maintenance instructions, insulation specification, GASENGDP046, MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation) are the same as those described for 'Insulation design' failure cause in the retrieved data with a matching context and system element identity. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be adopted directly and verified for consistency. Severity is rated 5 reflecting process disturbance/problems for some customers due to reduced oil life. Occurrence is rated 2 indicating unlikely occurrence due to effective preventive measures like insulation specification and maintenance instructions. Detection is rated 2 reflecting high likelihood of detection by MCE Functional Testing and field daily inspections before customer impact. These ratings are consistent and appropriate considering the given failure mode, cause, effect, and measures."
Transient engine operation conditions like start-up and cool-down phases creating condensation,Reduced oil life (degradation due to water contamination),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Condensation forming in filter over time' with failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' and failure effect 'Reduced oil life (degradation due to water)' was found exactly in 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the CCV (blow-by) system of the Engine Block subsystem. Our target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', which is a newer engine generation but same product category (gas engines), same subsystem and system element, same function, failure mode, cause, and failure effect context. Given operability and preventive/detective measures listed are very similar and highly overlapping with those for Type 4 data, the data can be adapted with minor adjustments accounting for possible improvements in Type 6 but similar operating conditions. Severity rating is directly applicable and consistent (5), reflecting moderate impact (reduced oil life may cause some customers/process disruption but no regulatory violation). Occurrence rating for this failure cause in the retrieved data is 5 (occasional occurrence) reflecting transient operation conditions that inherently cause condensation despite preventive measures. Given similar preventive controls and design maturity, this occurrence rating applies to Type 6 as well. Detection rating is 2 in retrieved data, indicating high likelihood of detection by current diagnostic and monitoring measures before customer impact due to multiple blow-by filter pressure, temperature, vibration and flow monitoring measures in place. This matches the described detective measures in the target context well, so detection rating remains at 2. This results in a reliable adapted risk rating set for the target system context based on similar context data with thorough rationale."
CCV (blow-by) system design,High service effort,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (CCV blow-by system), function, failure mode ('Replacement not possible'), failure cause ('CCV (blow-by) system design'), and failure effect ('High service effort') as the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The existing preventive and detective measures are identical. Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engine) within similar functional contexts, only differing by engine type/version. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings can be applied with high confidence without adjustment. Severity is consistent for the failure effect 'High service effort' at rating 5. Occurrence is low likelihood (3) considering effective preventive measures. Detection is excellent (2) due to robust detection methods. No adjustment needed given similar preventive/detective measures and no significant operational differences."
Design for maintenance,High service effort,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, CCV (blow-by) system, function 'Allow replacements of filters and separators', failure mode 'Replacement not possible' caused by 'Design for maintenance' leading to 'High service effort') exactly matches the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and preventive/detective measures. Both preventive and detective measures are the same, indicating similar effectiveness levels. Severity rating aligns with 'High service effort' as a mid-level impact (rating 5). Occurrence rating at 3 is consistent with occasional but controlled failure cause occurrence due to effective preventive measures. Detection rating of 2 reflects high probability of detection by existing functional and field validation testing. Given the close similarity and matching context, ratings can be applied directly without adjustment."
Piping design,High service effort,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' CCV (blow-by) system failure mode 'Replacement not possible' with cause 'Piping design' and effect 'High service effort' is highly similar to the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' matching subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect, differing only by engine version. The preventive and detective measures are consistent between the contexts. Therefore, the existing ratings can be applied with minimal adjustment. Severity rating of 5 reflects a moderate impact (high service effort) on maintenance/operation, which holds across similar engine types. Occurrence is rated 3 (low likelihood) considering effective preventive measures like FEA simulation and piping standards. Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection) given comprehensive multi-modal vibration, functional tests, and field validation measures in place. Given very close similarity in system and measures, no significant rating adjustment is needed."

Preventive and detective measures are a direct match indicating comparable risk controls and detection capability. Severity, occurrence, and detection ratings are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are needed as Gas Engine Type 6 version is assumed similar in context and criticality for this failure scenario."
Insulation design,High service effort,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context matches exactly with the retrieved data for Product category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), Function (Allow replacements of filters and separators), Failure Mode (Replacement not possible), Failure Cause (Insulation design), and Failure Effect (High service effort). Preventive and detective measures provided in the target system are exactly the same as those for the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 context, indicating equivalent effectiveness. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be used directly without modification."

The function 'Provide installation space for sensors' and failure effects related to sensor failure due to vibration are consistent. Preventive and detective measures are also aligned and comparable in nature and scope. Given the similar engine types (Type 6 vs Type 4) within the same product category and strong contextual and functional overlap, ratings can be adapted with minor reasoning adjustments. Severity remains the same as sensor damage is direct and relevant in both. Occurrence ratings can be applied directly as preventive measures such as FEA simulation, assembly checks, and maintenance plans are equivalent and similarly effective. Detection ratings remain consistent due to confirmed similar testing and validation procedures (vibration testing, functional testing, field monitoring). Overall, adaptation is minimal but acknowledges possible incremental improvements in engine evolution might slightly affect occurrence and detection, so minor rounding or cautious interpretation applied. Thus, Severity=4, Occurrence=3-5 range adapted per cause, Detection=2-4 range from the referenced data."

The retrieved data includes the exact same failure mode, failure causes related to design and maintenance issues, and failure effects within the 'Gas Engine Type 4', which shares the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem context. The function 'Provide installation space for sensors' and failure causes such as design limitations and maintenance restrictions are highly consistent. Preventive and detective measures are also similar and comprehensive, e.g., FEA simulation, maintenance instructions, functional testing, and field validation. Minor differences between Gas Engine Type 4 and 6 are expected to have limited impact on severity, occurrence, and detection due to the same operational principles and measures. Therefore, the risk ratings from the retrieved data apply directly without major adjustment, consistent with the rating methodology. Severity rating is stable at 5 for 'High service effort' and 'Potential operational downtime or increased costs' because this represents process disturbance affecting some customers. Occurrence ratings vary between 2 and 3 depending on failure cause, reflecting low to unlikely occurrence due to existing preventive design and maintenance controls. Detection ratings range mainly from 2-4, indicating high likelihood of early detection via functional testing and monitoring measures.

Retrieved data provides a very close match from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode and largely overlapping failure causes. Preventive and detective measures (e.g., FEA Simulation, Assembly Instructions, vibration testing) are similar. Severity of sensor failure rated as 4 in retrieved data for similar failure effect 'Sensor failure due to lack of mechanical support', confirming moderate process disturbance and minor customer problems. For assembly/design cause occurrence is medium (5) with moderate detection (4); for vibration/design causes lower occurrence (3) and better detection (2 to 4) given existing vibration and functional testing. Given the similarity of context and equivalent preventive/detective measures, these ratings are applicable with slight caution due to possible evolutions in Type 6. Severity 4 remains appropriate as sensor failure impacts service but is not catastrophic. Occurrence is maintained at 3 (low likelihood) for design-related causes with good preventive design and 5 for assembly-related cause due to inherent assembly variability. Detection ratings are kept between 2 and 4 depending on cause, reflecting moderate to high likelihood of detection before customer impact given extensive functional and vibration testing. Hence, we use the existing risk ratings directly, classified as SIMILAR_CONTEXT because product generation differs (Type 4 vs Type 6) but all functional and system context aligns well and measures are comparable."

Retrieved data shows exact same failure mode, system element (CCV), function (installation space for cable routing), and failure effects in a very similar context: Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, CCV system. Preventive measures match closely with very similar scope (FEA, design guidelines, assembly instructions, maintenance plans). Detective measures are minimal in both contexts (none explicitly for this failure mode). Severity rating for failure effect 'High service effort' from retrieved data is 5, fitting customer impact and process disturbance category. Occurrence ratings for failure causes range realistically from 2 (maintenance) to 5 (assembly/design for assembly) based on effectiveness of preventive measures. Detection ratings align with limited detection capability prior to customer impact, ranging from 2 (for design causes with functional tests) to 4 (assembly/process causes detected by checklist/trials). Given similar system function, preventive and detective measures, and identical failure mode and effects, these ratings are applicable with minimal adjustment for product type upgrade from Type 4 to Type 6. Thus, we assign the same severity (5), take occurrence ratings as per cause (for overall RPN, typically the highest or weighted cause rate considered - here assembly/design cause at occurrence=5 dominates), and detection consistent with the given ranges (lowest among the causes). This ensures consistency, realism, and provides actionable risk ratings for FMEA in the target context."

The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure causes and failure effect matches closely except for the product version difference (Type 4 vs Type 6). The function and failure causes align exactly with a shared product category (gas engines), subsystem, and system element. Preventive and detective measures for Type 6 are very similar or identical to those for Type 4, indicating comparable design and maintenance approaches. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are applicable, but small adjustments are considered for any incremental complexity or accessibility challenges that might arise in Type 6 due to newer design or increased complexity, which could slightly increase occurrence. Severity remains consistent as failure effect impact (high service effort, extended downtime) is comparable across types and is well rated at 5. Detection ratings from Type 4 data fit well given the mature functional and vibration testing in place and field validation means. Occurrence ratings are mostly moderate (2-3) reflecting preventive measures like FEA simulation and maintenance planning. Considering possible slightly higher complexity and no evident degradation of measures effectiveness, the occurrence rating is maintained or slightly adjusted upward for poorer serviceability causes where relevant. In conclusion, the severity rating is maintained at 5. Occurrence ratings as per failure cause range from 2 to 3, median 3, consistent with existing preventive measures. Detection ratings range from 2 to 4 depending on cause, reflecting good detection methods in place.

Preventive and detective measures match exactly. Slight vintage/generation difference may affect occurrence minimally, but preventive measures and detection capabilities appear consistent and robust. Severity is an impact on compressor/turbocharger performance leading to process/customer problems (severity 6) consistent with engineering judgment. Occurrence rated as 5 (occasional) fits given preventive maintenance plans and endurance testing availability. Detection rated 4 aligns with effective pressure monitoring measures in place allowing high likelihood of detection before delivery. Therefore, reuse retrieved ratings directly with minor contextual validation."
Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.),Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) is very similar to the retrieved data context (Gas Engine Type 4) with the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), same function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. The preventive and detective measures reported are identical or very closely aligned. Given the similarity in product category (both gas engines), subsystem, and identical failure scenario, the retrieved ratings are highly applicable. Minor adjustments are not required since the preventive and detective measures effectiveness and failure effect severity do not appear significantly different in Gas Engine Type 6. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings from Gas Engine Type 4 for the failure cause 'Oil deposit build up...' and failure mode 'Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time' can be adopted directly for Gas Engine Type 6."
Crankcase design,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data perfectly matches the target system context on Product category (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6 - similar product line), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), Function (Maintain oil concentration limit during blow-by separation), Failure Mode (Exceeds oil concentration limit over time), Failure Cause (Crankcase design), and Failure Effect (Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)). The preventive and detective measures align exactly, and the product category is similar enough to consider the engines as same product family with very similar operating context. Therefore, risk ratings from the Gas Engine Type 4 data can be directly applied without adjustment."

Preventive and detective measures listed are identical and comprehensive, supporting the applicability of the existing ratings without adjustment. The retrieved data gives Severity=6, Occurrence=3, Detection=2, which align well with all defined rating criteria given the failure effect impact (moderate process disturbance, problems for some customers), low likelihood of failure cause due to strong preventive actions, and very high likelihood of detection due to functional testing and field monitoring. Thus, the existing risk ratings are accurate and appropriate for the target context."
Design for maintenance,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"EXACT_MATCH: All key attributes including Product Category (Gas Engine), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system), Function (Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during blow-by separation), Failure Mode (Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time), Failure Cause (Design for maintenance), and Failure Effect (Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)) match exactly with the retrieved FMEA data from Gas Engine Type 4.

Therefore, the risk ratings from the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 can be directly applied to Gas Engine Type 6 without adjustment."
Piping design,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, CCV (blow-by) system, function and failure mode 'Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time', failure cause 'Piping design', failure effect 'Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)') matches closely the retrieved data for the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and cause but from a different product version (Gas Engine Type 4). The product category, subsystem, system element, failure mode, cause, and effect are consistent, and preventive/detective measures are similar. This constitutes a similar context where risk ratings need adjustment based on possible differences in product maturity, operating conditions, or design improvements in Type 6 vs Type 4. Since the existing preventive and detective measures are explicitly stated and align with the retrieved data, the occurrence rating remains low due to effective preventive action (FEA simulation and piping spec GASENGDP048) and detection rating is moderate due to multiple functional and field tests. Severity is consistent given that the failure effect (excess oil to turbocharger) impact is stable across engine types, so severity remains at 6. Therefore, we keep Severity=6, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 in line with retrieved Type 4 data adapted to Type 6, as no evidence or description suggests substantial change in risk level or measures effectiveness."

Both preventive and detective measures are identical, indicating that the risk environment and controls are comparable.

"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The provided retrieved data is from a closely related product 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'CCV (blow-by) system', same function 'Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation', identical failure mode 'Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time', failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)', and failure effect 'Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)'. The preventive and detective measures in the target context are essentially the same or highly similar to those defined in the retrieved data. Minor differences in product type (Type 6 vs Type 4) likely do not substantially alter severity or detectability; occurrence could vary slightly due to operational differences between engine types but given the identical measures, the occurrence rating remains valid. Thus, the retrieved risk ratings can be used with confidence for the target system with no adjustment: Severity 6 (process disturbance, problems for some customers—excessive oil harms turbocharger function but no direct regulatory or severe financial impact), Occurrence 5 (occasional occurrence given current preventive measures like FEA and system specs), Detection 4 (high likelihood of detection through multiple functional and pressure monitoring systems before customer impact)."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data matches almost exactly in all key aspects (Subsystem: Engine Block, SystemElement: CCV (blow-by) system, Function: Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during blow-by separation, FailureMode: Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time, FailureCause: Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level), FailureEffect: Too much oil guided to compressor). The difference is only in the product version (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6), both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and share very similar operational and maintenance contexts. Preventive (Maintenance Plan and Instruction) and detective measures (Crankcase pressure monitoring, Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring) are also identical. Hence, the exact retrieved ratings are applicable with confidence without adjustment because the context and measures equivalently apply."
Power unit,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data shows an exact match in failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, preventive and detective measures but is related to 'Gas Engine Type 4' instead of the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and have identical subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('CCV (blow-by) system'), and function. The operational and technical environment is expected to be very similar, with no indication that severity, occurrence, or detection would differ solely due to the engine version change. Preventive measures ('GASENGDP007 Power Unit', 'Design verification of power unit') and detective measures ('MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring', 'Blow-By Filter differential pressure monitoring') are the same. Hence, the retrieved risk ratings for Severity=6, Occurrence=6, and Detection=5 are highly applicable. Minor variability in engine design may exist between types 4 and 6, but no evidence supports rating adjustments. Therefore, ratings are adopted as-is to maintain consistency and reliability."
Turbocharger,Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure mode 'Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time' with failure cause 'Turbocharger' and effect 'Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)' is found in retrieved data on similar Gas Engine Type 4 (vs target Gas Engine Type 6) with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and preventive/detective measures. The slight product model difference (Type 4 vs Type 6) implies highly similar operating context and customer impact. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are applicable with no adjustment needed, supported by the consistent preventive and detective controls ensuring similar occurrence and detection likelihood."
Oil system (oil level sensor),Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, CCV system, failure mode 'Exceeds the oil concentration limit over time', failure cause 'Oil system (oil level sensor)') is highly similar to the retrieved exact context data from Gas Engine Type 4 with identical subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause, and the same preventive and detective measures. Both use CCV (blow-by) system in the engine block with the same failure mode and cause. Since the product differs only in engine type (Type 4 vs. Type 6) within the gas engine product category and the failure mode context is aligned, it is a similar context per the matrix. The engine type 6 likely shares similar operating and customer impact characteristics to type 4. Therefore, the failure effect severity of 6 (process disturbance, problems for some customers) is appropriate and consistent given the failure effect 'Too much oil guided to the compressor (turbocharger)'. Preventive measures 'Engine oil pan design' and 'Sensor specification' are robust enough to warrant an occurrence rating of 2 (unlikely occurrence). Detective measures including 'MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)' and 'Crankcase pressure monitoring' provide a high likelihood of detection (rating 4). No significant changes in risk drivers justify altering these ratings for the Gas Engine Type 6 context. Hence, ratings from the retrieved data are adopted with confirmation of applicability."
"Inadequate vibration isolation material properties, degradation or damage to isolator components, improper assembly leading to isolation displacement, bolted joint loosening affecting isolator mounting",Increased vibrational energy transmission to adjacent components causing fatigue damage and accelerated wear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Vibration isolation ineffective' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is functionally and contextually highly similar to the retrieved failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in related components (front end housing, crankcase) within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both concern vibration-related issues impacting structural components and leading to fatigue damage, loosening of bolted joints, and accelerated wear. The preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved data (Design acc. to specification, Bolted joint calculations, involvement of production and service teams, MCE testbench performance testing, vibration measurement, bolted joint preload measurement, endurance running inspections) closely match the target system measures, supporting applicability. However, slight adaptation is needed for severity and occurrence: Gas Engine Type 6 likely shares similar customer impact (fatigue damage and wear affecting reliability and maintenance intervals) so severity aligns around a rating of 7 as in the retrieved data. Occurrence is set to occasional (rating 4-6 in retrieved data) but considering the thorough preventive measures and advanced simulation and testing, occurrence is rated moderate at 4. Detection rating matches the retrieved value of 6 due to the extensive testbench and endurance run inspections enabling detection before customer impact but only through targeted inspections, not 100% certain detection. Consistency with retrieved ratings ensures a balanced view reflecting actual measures and severity impact for this vibration isolation failure mode in a similar system context."
"Design flaws in bolted joint or mount geometry tolerances, crankcase and housing design not optimized for vibration damping, assembly errors leading to misalignment, improper torque on fastening components","Loosening of bolted joints, fatigue related damage on interface components, increased noise generation, sensor failures, potential for structural collapse","SIMILAR_CONTEXT due to matching system element (Engine Block - Vibration isolation related to vibration and bolted joint integrity issues), similar function to reduce vibration transmission, and related failure causes (design flaws, geometry tolerances, bolted joint design, crankcase design, assembly errors). Although data is from Gas Engine Type 4 vs Gas Engine Type 6, both share the same product category and subsystem (Engine Block) and have consistent preventive and detective measures. The failure mode 'Overfunction (Excessive vibration)' is closely related to 'Vibration is too high' and 'Insufficient structural support' failure modes in retrieved data which impact bolted joints, fatigue damage, noise, sensor failures, and structural integrity, aligning with the target failure effects. Severity is adapted slightly higher to reflect the potential for structural collapse and sensor failures noted in target context, occurrence is aligned with effective preventive measures reducing likelihood to occasional, and detection is consistent with extensive vibration measurement and bolted joint preload monitoring capabilities reducing detection difficulty. This yields a balanced risk rating informed by close analogues in similar subsystem context with justified adjustments due to severity differences."
"Inadequate design incorporating natural frequency of mounts, resonance phenomena caused by geometry and material interaction, assembly tolerance stack-up inducing vibrational hotspots",Amplified noise quality issues and increased likelihood of sensitive sensor failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Vibration isolation element with failure mode 'Unintended function' causing amplified noise and sensor failures. The retrieved data shows multiple failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high', 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification' in Gas Engine Type 4 (same product category, same subsystem, similar system element and function related to vibration control). The failure causes and preventive/detective measures align closely with target causes (design issues, resonance, assembly tolerances). Severity ratings in retrieved data for noise issues are 7 (noise quality issues), for sensor failure 4, matching target failure effects. Occurrence ratings for assembly/design-related causes are around 5 and for design-related causes around 3, reflecting similar preventive measures involving multi-team design processes and simulations. Detection ratings for vibration-related issues are consistently around 6, indicating detection via multiple test bench simulations, endurance runs and vibration measurements, which matches target detective measures. Considering the Type 6 is an evolution from Type 4, with comparable engineering rigor and preventive/detective controls, I adapt the retrieved ratings directly with minor confirmation. Severity is set by failure effect impact consistent with retrieved data: 7 for noise amplification (customer dissatisfaction) and 4 for sensor failure (process disturbances). Occurrence is maintained at 5 reflecting occasional occurrence despite extensive measures. Detection is kept at 6 reflecting detection through targeted inspections and endurance testing before customer release. Overall, this approach preserves consistency and reflects the effectiveness of the existing measures in the target context."
Incorrect material selection or improper design tolerances causing insufficient damping,Elevated vibration levels causing local fatigue damage and possible loosening of assembly joints,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Vibration isolation', with failure mode 'Functional limitation of vibration isolation (reduced damping efficiency)' caused by 'Incorrect material selection or improper design tolerances causing insufficient damping', leading to 'Elevated vibration levels causing local fatigue damage and possible loosening of assembly joints'. Existing data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem Engine Block shows the failure mode 'Vibration is too high' for structural parts (damper housing, crankcase) caused by design, tolerance, assembly, and material issues leading to fatigue damage and loosening of joints. This aligns well with the target failure mode and failure cause, although the exact elements differ slightly (vibration isolation vs damper housing). Severity from retrieved data for fatigue damage and loosening joints is rated 7, which matches the significant customer impact (fatigue failure with risk of assembly loosening). The preventive measures and detective methods in the target system are similar in scope and intent to those in the retrieved context, such as design to spec, tolerance analysis, FEA simulations, and vibration and endurance testing. Occurrence ratings for causes related to design and tolerance issues cluster around 3 to 5 in the retrieved data, reflecting occasional but controlled occurrence due to preventive measures. Detection ratings mostly cluster around 6 (detection by targeted inspections/testbenches and some measurement), which corresponds well to the existing detective measures described for vibration isolation. Therefore, it is appropriate to adapt retrieved ratings to the target system with slight reasoning: severity rating S=7 reflects fatigue damage and loosening; occurrence rating O=4 reflects occasional occurrence due to material/design tolerance issues despite comprehensive preventive controls; detection rating D=6 reflecting effective targeted testbench and endurance run inspections but no certain detection before delivery is typical."
Assembly process errors impacting vibration damping components,Fatigue damage to engine block structural components leading to potential cracking or failure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context involves 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Vibration isolation', with failure mode 'Vibration amplitude exceeds design limits' caused by 'Assembly process errors impacting vibration damping components', leading to 'Fatigue damage to engine block structural components leading to potential cracking or failure'. The retrieved data shows very similar failure modes ('Vibration is too high') occurring in 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', with assembly process as cause, preventive measures involving design team involvement, and comprehensive testbench and monitoring detective measures—essentially analogous in technical context, preventive/detective approaches, and failure effect nature (fatigue related damage, structural issues). Given the higher engine type number (likely evolutionary improvement) but comparable design & testing rigor, slight adjustment from Type 4 data is prudent. Severity is aligned with fatigue damage causing structural cracking (rated 7 in similar cases, reflecting reduced service but significant component damage). Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence), consistent with assembly process errors despite involvement from multiple teams. Detection is rated 6, as testbench and monitoring allow targeted inspections but do not guarantee early detection before fatigue damage onset. This rating set reflects strong correlation with retrieved similar context and adjusted to Type 6 context, adhering to all rating consistency rules."
"Geometry tolerances not meeting specification, leading to misalignment and compromised vibration isolation",Excessive structural movement with loss of stiffness increasing noise and vibration-induced loosening of bolts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support due to design tolerance deviations causing excessive structural movement and vibration-induced loosening' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches failure modes related to 'Insufficient structural support' and vibration issues in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same subsystem and product category. The retrieved data includes closely matching failure modes such as 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Vibration is too high' caused by 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', with similar preventive and detective measures. The primary difference is nominally the specific engine type (Type 4 vs Type 6) and a slightly different system element focus, but both are within the same product category and engine block context, sharing very similar preventive and detective measures (design per specification, tolerance stackup, involvement of control and service teams, and extensive MCE testbench and endurance testing). Therefore, the retrieved occurrence and detection ratings are directly applicable, with minor consideration that newer engine Type 6 may have similar or slightly improved measures but no evidence suggests a significant difference warranting adjustment. Severity is rated based on the failure effect of 'Excessive structural movement with loss of stiffness increasing noise and loosening of bolts', consistent with similar effects rated as severity 8 in 'Insufficient structural support' failure modes in retrieved data, due to impact to structural integrity, customer dissatisfaction, and potential for dissatisfied performance and operational interruptions. Thus, Severity = 8, Occurrence = 3 (geometry tolerances cause, preventive measures effective, low likelihood), Detection = 4 (MCE testbench vibration and assembly tests provide high likelihood of detection but no complete certainty before delivery)."
Inadequate damping design or insufficient modal analysis during design phase,Sustained high vibration levels resulting in accelerated material fatigue and noise quality degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Sticking at certain vibration frequency due to resonance' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem's 'Vibration isolation' system element. The retrieved data show multiple failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high' and related vibration-caused issues in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both are gas engines, same subsystem and similar system elements related to vibration and structural integrity. Preventive and detective measures are very similar (FEA, simulations, design involvement, vibration measurements, endurance tests, testbench). The failure cause (inadequate damping design or insufficient modal analysis) aligns with causes of high vibration due to design issues in the retrieved data. The failure effect—sustained high vibration leading to accelerated material fatigue and noise degradation—matches well with retrieved failure effects rated severity 7 for fatigue damage and noise quality issues. Therefore, severity is assigned 7 consistent with similar failure effects ('Fatigue related damage', 'Noise quality issues'). The occurrence rating for similar design-related causes is generally 3 to 5 depending on involvement of teams and simulation methods. Given the target preventive measures include detailed design validation and team involvement, the occurrence is rated at 3 (low likelihood) reflecting existing strong preventive efforts. Detection is rated 6 for vibration-related design failure causes in the retrieved data, consistent with reliance on targeted inspections and test benches before delivery. The detection methods listed (vibration measurement, MCE testbench, endurance inspection, oil/coolant monitoring) provide moderate detectability before failure customer impact. This rating reflects chance of detection through these measures but not guaranteed before customer impact. Hence, detection is rated 6. This adaptation accounts for the very similar system context (same product category, subsystem, system element, failure mode and cause type, and failure effect), but higher gas engine type (Type 6) may have slight improvements in design robustness, thus slightly lower occurrence than some Type 4 data. Severity is consistent with validated values for the effects described. Overall, SIMILAR_CONTEXT rating is justified with analytical adjustment on occurrence and confirmation of severity and detection."
Improper installation or design of isolation mounts leading to directional stiffness mismatch,Transmitted forces in unintended axes causing abnormal stress concentrations and component wear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Incorrect vibration isolation direction' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely matches the context of vibration-related failure modes (e.g. 'Vibration is too high') within the same product category (Gas Engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) from the retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data. Although the exact failure mode and cause are not present, the functional context (vibration transmission, structural integrity) and preventive/detective measures show strong similarity, indicating that vibration issues due to assembly and design cause moderate to high occurrence ratings and detection difficulty. The severity of transmitted forces causing abnormal stress and wear is analogous to fatigue damage or loosening of components caused by vibration, previously rated severity 7. The preventive measures listed are comparable or possibly more comprehensive in the target context, implying occurrence should be mid-range to occasional (rating 4), considering the involvement of multidisciplinary design teams and advanced simulation (FEA), yet the complexity of directional isolation may introduce some risk of improper installation/design. Detection methods are robust (testbench, vibration measurement, endurance run), allowing targeted inspections with some likelihood of failure discovery before customer impact, paralleling detection ratings of 5-6 in similar vibration contexts. Hence, applying these analogous ratings with attention to the directional isolation specifics results in Severity=7, Occurrence=4, Detection=6, reflecting moderate to high impact, occasional occurrence due to complex installation, and intermediate detection capability."
"Design flaws such as insufficient isolation material thickness, inadequate mount geometry, wrong damping coefficient",Accelerated fatigue failure and loosening of bolted joints causing potential engine block damage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loss of function, functional limitation, or unintended function due to vibration isolation failure' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is functionally similar to the well-documented failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in the 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both involve vibration-related issues leading to loosening of bolted joints and eventual structural fatigue/damage. Preventive and detective measures are largely comparable, with similar design control methods, simulations, involvement of cross-functional teams, and extensive testing. The effect severity in the retrieved data for 'Loosening of bolted joints' causing fatigue/damage is rated 7, consistent with 'reduced service and dissatisfaction' level, which aligns with our target failure effect of potential engine block damage via fatigue failure. As our system is a newer generation but same product category and highly analogous in subsystem and system element function, the Severity rating of 7 is applicable without down- or up-scaling. The occurrence rating for similar design flaw causes ranges from 3 (Bolted joint design) to 5 (Assembly/process), reflecting occasional to low-moderate likelihood despite robust preventive measures. Our target preventive measures are similarly strong, so adopting the occurrence rating of 3-5, leaning on the median cautious value of 4 (occasional occurrence) accounts for some variability in design/damping parameters and practical assembly risks. Detection rating in retrieved data for bolted joint design related vibration issues is uniformly 6, indicating detection only via targeted inspection before delivery (MCE testbench, preload measurement, vibration measurement). The target system employs the same detective measure set, so a detection rating of 6 is consistent. Hence, the adapted risk ratings are: Severity 7, Occurrence 4, Detection 6."
Incorrect design tolerances or assembly leading to pre-load errors or misalignment of vibration isolator components,Partial transmission of vibration frequencies beyond specified limits causing noise quality issues and accelerated wear of bolted joints,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT due to the following reasons: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode of 'Functional limitation of vibration isolation' (reduced damping effectiveness) caused by incorrect design tolerances or assembly leading to pre-load errors or misalignment. This scenario is functionally highly similar to the retrieved failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in Gas Engine Type 4. Both concern vibration-related issues within engine block subsystems, involve design tolerances and assembly causes, and lead to increased vibration transmission impacting bolted joints and noise quality. The retrieved data uses occurrence ratings (3–5) and detection ratings around 6 for similar causes with preventive measures such as team involvement in design, tolerance specs, simulations, and extensive testbench and measurement test methods. The failure effects of noise quality issues and loosening or accelerated wear of bolted joints in the retrieved data have a severity rating of 7, which aligns well with the target failure effect of partial vibration transmission causing noise and accelerated wear. Therefore, the retrieved ratings are a suitable baseline. Adjustments: Severity is set to 7 as in retrieved context, reflecting customer dissatisfaction and component wear without immediate regulatory or critical safety impact. Occurrence is rated 4 (lower mid of 4–6 range “occasional occurrence”) versus 5 in retrieved data to reflect the possibly improved preventive measures stated (like tolerance stackup analysis and multi-discipline team involvement), suggesting slightly better control than in Type 4 engines. Detection rating kept at 6 consistent with retrieved detection rating reflecting detection primarily through targeted vibration and assembly testing, testbench performance, and endurance runs before delivery. This balance reflects that detection measures are sophisticated but not fully certain before customer delivery. Overall, this aligns with SIMILAR_CONTEXT action: applying retrieved ratings with slight occurrence adjustment based on preventive measures' effectiveness in the target system context."
"Transient engine operation conditions (start-up, cool-down) causing dynamic changes in vibration isolation stiffness or damping characteristics",Intermittent excessive vibration leading to sensor malfunction or inaccurate vibration readings affecting engine monitoring,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Functional fluctuation of vibration isolation performance' in 'Vibration isolation' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to retrieved failure modes 'Vibration is too high' and 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification' in 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both deal with vibration issues affecting sensors and engine monitoring. The failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start-up, cool-down)' with similar preventive measures (Design acc. to spec, Tolerances, FEA, MBS) and detective measures (Vibration measurement, Endurance run) is directly found with occurrence rating 5 and detection rating 6 for the 'Vibration is too high' failure mode in retrieved data. Severity is assigned according to failure effect on sensor malfunction or inaccurate vibration readings impacting engine monitoring. 'Vibration is too high' assigns severity 4 for sensor failure and 7 for loosened joints or damage, but the effect here is 'Intermittent excessive vibration leading to sensor malfunction or inaccurate vibration readings' which is comparable to 'Sensor failure' severity 4 from retrieved data. Thus, severity is rated 4, as it is a customer-impacting but not regulation-violating or causing financial damage event. Occurrence is kept at 5 (occasional occurrence) due to transient engine operation that cannot be fully eliminated despite preventive measures. Detection rating is set at 6 because detection relies on targeted inspections such as vibration measurement and endurance runs, with no certain detection before customer impact, consistent with retrieved data. Slight adaptation from Gas Engine Type 4 to Type 6 is justified as vibration isolation may have similar performance but transient effects remain challenging to eliminate. Preventive and detective measures are similar in nature and effectiveness. Hence, SIMILAR_CONTEXT ratings are appropriate with minimal adjustment for context differences."
"Incorrect vibration isolation natural frequency due to design or assembly errors, leading to resonance with engine operating frequencies","Severe vibration spikes causing loosening of bolted joints, accelerated fatigue damage, and noise emission problems","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same product category (gas engines), subsystem (Engine Block), and similar system element function (vibration control) with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure mode 'Unintended vibration amplification (resonance amplification)' is conceptually very close to 'Vibration is too high' and causes very similar effects (loosening of bolted joints, fatigue damage, noise emission). However, the exact element is 'Vibration isolation' (not front end housing or crankcase) and the cause is specific to vibration isolation natural frequency mismatch, slightly different than multiple design and assembly causes in the retrieved data. Preventive measures overlap (involving production, controls, service teams), and detective measures largely overlap (MCE testbench tests, vibration measurement, endurance run). Severity is aligned since effects are severe (loosening, fatigue, noise), occurrence should be adjusted reflecting controlled design involvement, and detection aligns with extensive testing capability documented. Minor adaptations are applied: Severity maintained at 7 (aligned with retrieved severity for loosening and fatigue), Occurrence chosen as moderate (5) consistent with assembly/design preventive measures effectiveness, Detection kept at 6 reflecting detection through targeted inspection (MCE and vibration monitoring)."
Improper assembly alignment causing partial decoupling of vibration damper interface,Partial increase in noise levels; potential localized stress concentration causing accelerated component wear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Functional limitation - Reduced damping efficiency' due to 'Improper assembly alignment causing partial decoupling of vibration damper interface' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares high similarity with documented failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' within 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both deal with vibration-related issues affecting interface components connected to the engine block, involving assembly/design for assembly causes, and similar preventive measures (involvement of production, controls, service teams) and detective measures (MCE testbench overload/performance/assembly tests, vibration measurement, endurance runs). Although the exact system element differs (vibration isolation vs damper housing), the function of damping vibration and its effect on noise/stress and wear is analogous. Severity ratings for vibration-related interface damage and noise issues in retrieved data range from 7 to 8. Occurrence ratings for assembly-related issues in vibration contexts are consistently around 5, reflecting occasional occurrence despite preventive design involvement. Detection ratings are around 6, representing detection via extensive testbench and inspection regime prior to customer delivery. The known failure effect severity of 7 (noise increase, fatigue damage) aligns well with the target failure effect of 'Partial increase in noise levels and localized stress causing accelerated wear', thus severity is set to 7. Occurrence is maintained at 5 given the similar preventive measures and likelihood of partial decoupling due to assembly misalignment. Detection is rated 6 in line with similar failure modes where detection requires targeted and in-depth inspections and testing (like MCE testbench, vibration measurement, endurance inspection). This rating reflects existing comprehensive detective measures that offer relatively good but not immediate detection. Hence, applying and adapting the retrieved ratings logically fits the target system with minor adjustment for the slightly different vibration isolation context but same preventive/detective framework."
Thermal expansion mismatch or transient loading conditions during engine startup/shutdown affecting damper stiffness,Intermittent noise and vibration spikes perceived by user; accelerated fatigue damage on mounting components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Functional fluctuation - Variable damping performance under transient engine operation' in 'Vibration isolation' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact match in retrieved data. However, a highly relevant retrieved failure mode is 'Vibration is too high' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' within the 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' which addresses vibration-related issues, fatigue damage, noise quality, and effects on mounting components under transient engine operation. Both concern vibration effects in structural interfaces exposed to transient loading and thermal effects. Differences lie in system elements ('Vibration isolation' vs 'damper housing') and exact product generation (Type 6 vs Type 4). Existing preventive and detective measures are analogous (FEA, MBS, vibration measurements, endurance runs). Severity is adapted slightly higher (7) given intermittent noise plus accelerated fatigue damage on mounting components, likely more critical in new engine type and functional fluctuation context. Occurrence is aligned with similar transient loading causes in vibration modes rated at 5, reflecting effective but not perfect preventive measures. Detection rating aligns with vibration measurement and endurance run detection capability, rated at 6, consistent with common vibration issues detection limitations before customer detects. This approach applies retrieved data critically adjusted for product generation and exact function differences."
Resonance due to improper damper geometry or manufacturing variances,Amplified vibration at resonance frequencies impacting engine block structural integrity and noise emission,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Unintended function - Vibration isolator transmits vibrations at specific frequencies' caused by resonance due to improper damper geometry or manufacturing variances in the Engine Block subsystem. The retrieved data shows a highly similar failure mode 'Vibration is too high' occurring in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component within the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4, caused by geometry tolerances and design issues affecting vibration behavior. Both involve vibration transmission at interfaces leading to structural and noise issues. Preventive measures (FEA, simulation, tolerance controls) and detective measures (vibration measurements, testbench testing) are very comparable. Minor differences in engine type and damper specifics suggest slightly adjusted risk posture is warranted. Severity aligns with fatigue and structural integrity impact (rating 7). Occurrence for resonance related to geometry tolerances and design variances is low due to extensive preventive measures (rating 3). Detection is moderate difficulty requiring targeted inspections and testbench vibration measurements (rating 6). Thus, adapting retrieved ratings for the target Gas Engine Type 6 context provides a robust, consistent assessment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly issues; Bolted joint design deficiencies; Crankcase design faults; Front/End cover design deficiencies; Geometry tolerances deviations; Pipe design factors,Damage on interface components; Lack of stiffness (excessive movement); Loosening of bolts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Vibration isolation, with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by multiple design and assembly issues. Retrieved data provides very similar failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' occurring in Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem (e.g., rear end cover, front end housing) with nearly identical failure causes (assembly process, bolted joint design, crankcase design, geometry tolerances, front/end cover design, pipe design). Preventive and detective measures closely match or are equivalent in rigor and scope. Severity ratings for failure effects (damage on interface components, lack of stiffness, loosening of bolts) are consistently rated 8, reflecting significant customer dissatisfaction and reduced system integrity. Occurrence ratings for similar causes range mostly 3 (design causes) to 5 (assembly process issues), with detection ratings 3-4 reflecting reasonable detection capability via existing test benches and measurements. No major context changes in customer impact or failure consequence are noted between Type 4 and Type 6 engines for these failure modes. Therefore, retrieved risk ratings are highly applicable with minimal adjustments. Considering Type 6 engine might have marginally different assembly complexity or slightly improved inspection technologies but overall similar control level, the ratings remain unchanged. Thus, Severity = 8, Occurrence = 5 (assembly process dominant cause), Detection = 4 (high likelihood of detection in test and measurement)."
