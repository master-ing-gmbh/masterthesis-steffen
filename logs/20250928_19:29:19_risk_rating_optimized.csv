"['Bolted joint design', 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Liner design (geometry, material etc.)', 'Gasket design', 'Wrong maintenance']",Combustion gas is exiting (combustion chamber),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Leakage of combustion gases' at the 'Cylinder liner assembly' in the 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches closely related failure mode 'Insufficient contact between gasket and liner' (failure_mode_id: 46) in the same subsystem, system element, and function context. Both involve sealing interfaces between liner/gasket and combustion chamber or crankcase, leading to leakage effects impacting engine operation. The retrieved data for related causes ('Bolted joint design', 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Liner design', 'Gasket design', 'Wrong maintenance') are very similar in preventive/detective measures, occurrence, and detection ratings. Severity rating for leakage of combustion gases causing combustion gas exiting to environment is high but less severe than critical oil or gas leakage with explosion risk, so should be aligned with severe engine damage but no direct regulatory violation shown in data. Severity from related failure modes ('Engine shutdown due to liner crack' rated 7) and leakage effects with gas leak rated between 4 and 7 supports moderately high severity. Occurrence ratings for bolted joint design and assembly process in related failure modes range from 3 to 5 considering preventive measures in place, so usage of 3-4 is appropriate. Detection ratings for these causes in similar failure modes are mostly in range 3-4 or 4-6 where sophisticated tests and assembly inspections exist but leakage may escape some intermediate detection, so a detection rating of 4 is justified. Hence, adapted ratings reflecting somewhat lower severity than highest environmental leakages, moderate occurrence due to good simulation and design prevention, and reasonably effective detection due to multiple inspections and functional tests are recommended."

Occurrence ratings for causes mostly range from 1 to 3 (except gasket design at 2 and wrong maintenance at 1), indicating low likelihood to occasional occurrence, coherent with effective preventive measures like FEA simulations and design specs. Detection ratings are consistently at 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes), which fits the comprehensive functional and field testing measures in place. Thus, the risk ratings accurately reflect the failure mode, causes, and effect considering the current control measures."

The preventive and detective measures align directly with the retrieved data. Severity is consistently rated at 7, indicating a high customer impact with engine stoppage and damage but no regulatory/financial catastrophe beyond customer dissatisfaction or operational loss. Occurrence is rated as 3 due to the effectiveness of existing preventive measures like GASENGDP018 Liner, FEA Simulation, and Drawing specifications limiting the likelihood. Detection rating varies slightly depending on detective measures: 'MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)', 'Field Validation', 'MCE Functional Testing (Cavitation)', etc. yield detection rating of 5 (detection through targeted inspection), while 'Overload and endurance run' shows slightly better detection at 4. For the provided detective measures (including all mentioned above), the detection rating appropriately fits at 4 to 5. Considering the target's full set of detective measures (including 'Overload and endurance run'), adopting the better detection rating of 4 is justified, indicating fairly effective detection before delivery but not foolproof.

The target failure mode 'Adverse piston motion' caused by 'Crankcase design' with failure effect 'Engine stop because of engine damage' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 4' has directly matching retrieved FMEA data. The only variation is the function named as 'Absorption of piston loads' in the target and 'Guidance for power unit' in retrieved data, which are closely related functional descriptions within the same system element. The preventive and detective measures provided in the target are identical to those in the retrieved scenario. Severity rating of 7 is consistent with the failure effect impact as it indicates serious engine damage causing engine stop (customer dissatisfied, reduced service). Occurrence rating of 3 reflects the moderate likelihood given effective preventive design and simulations related to crankcase and liner. Detection ratings vary slightly between 4 and 5 depending on detective measures used; with the detector measures including both functional testing and endurance runs, detection rating of 4-5 is consistent. Selecting detection rating 4 for the broader coverage of detective measures (as it includes 'Overload and endurance run' plus 'MCE Functional Testing') is appropriate. Overall, the retrieved data fully support direct use of severity=7, occurrence=3, detection=4 in the target context without adjustment."

The existing preventive measures such as FEA, VDI 2230, DP49 - Bolted joint, DP42 - Cylinder head, calculation and model analyses are identical, as is the detective measure (Bolted joint pre-load measurement). The risk ratings from the retrieved data are Severity 7, Occurrence 4, Detection 3 which align well with the failure effect (causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction but not regulatory or severe financial violation), occasional occurrence with good preventive measures, and reasonably high likelihood of detection in process. There is no need for adaptation."
O-Ring material selection,Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure,"EXACT_MATCH as the target system context matches exactly with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, function 'Contact to cylinder head assembly', failure mode 'Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase', failure cause 'O-Ring material selection', and failure effect 'Water: Overheating of cylinder head leading to component failure'; preventive and detective measures also align perfectly with retrieved data, thus no adjustment needed."

The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data ('DP42 - Cylinder head', 'Material specification', 'Tolerance stack up' for prevention and 'Assembly test', 'MCE test' for detection) perfectly match those given in the target system context. Thus, the given ratings can be used directly without adjustment. Severity is set at 10 due to the critical safety and efficiency impact (gas leakage poses a risk of gas in the room and efficiency loss), occurrence is low at 2 reflecting effective preventive measures, and detection is very good at 2 indicating high likelihood of detecting the failure cause before customer impact."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Engine misfiring,"EXACT_MATCH with direct usage of retrieved ratings from the same Product, Subsystem, System Element, Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect. The ratings align with the preventive and detective measures listed, which perfectly match the target system context: preventive measures include Supplier recommendation, FEA, CFD Analysis, External consultation, and 1d simulation (performance); detective measures include Performance test and Thermal survey (V-room shield). Occurrence is high (9) reflecting the known challenges despite measures; severity is 6 consistent with impact on engine misfiring affecting some customers/processes; detection is 4 meaning high likelihood of detection through performance test before customer delivery. No adaptation needed as this is a fully matching context."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context exactly matches a retrieved FMEA entry with the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly), failure mode (Too low gas intake to cylinder head), failure cause (Intake manifold and V-room design), and failure effect (Decrease of combustion efficiency -> loss of power output). Both preventive and detective measures are consistent between target and retrieved context. The retrieved ratings are Severity=6, Occurrence=9, and Detection=4. These ratings align with the failure effect impact (process disturbance, power loss but no regulatory or safety violation) and the existing robust preventive measures that are extensive but occurrence remains high, with detective measures providing a good chance of detection. Therefore, use the retrieved ratings directly."
Deposit in intake system,Engine misfiring,"EXACT_MATCH: Retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4 product context, same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Crankcase), identical function, failure mode ('Too low gas intake to cylinder head'), failure cause ('Deposit in intake system'), and failure effect ('Engine misfiring') matches the target context exactly. Preventive and detective measures also match exactly (Preventive: 'Selection of gas quality requirements'; Detective: 'Endurance run (performance degradation)', 'Field validation (performance degradation)'). Therefore, the risk ratings from retrieved data are directly applicable without adjustment."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure scenario concerns 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for the 'Gas Engine Type 4' product. The retrieved data provides exact matching failure modes with the same failure cause ('Material selection') but in the 'V-room insulation' system element, which although different from the crankcase, is in the same subsystem, part of the same gas flow path, and within the same product context. Preventive and detective measures are nearly identical between target and retrieved data, indicating comparable control effectiveness and likelihood of occurrence and detection. The failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' is rated with a severity of 5 consistently in retrieved data. Given the similarity of function (directing air/gas/mixture to cylinder head) and failure effect severity, the severity rating remains the same at 5. The occurrence rating in retrieved data is 5, reflecting occasional occurrence considering preventive measures like '1d simulation', 'FEA Simulation', and material specifications which apply also to the crankcase scenario. Detection rating of 4 indicates a high likelihood of detection during functional testing and validation processes, consistent with the given detective measures. Because the target's preventive and detective measures match retrieved data closely, and the functional context difference (crankcase vs V-room insulation) does not materially affect severity or detection, the retrieved ratings are adapted directly without adjustment."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' with cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' and effect 'Drop in engine performance' matches exactly with retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', and failure mode and cause identical in 'V-room insulation' component. Although the system element is 'Crankcase' here and retrieved is 'V-room insulation', both belong to the same subsystem (Engine Block) in the same product, and functionally relate to directing the air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head assembly which is the same functional context. Preventive and detective measures listed are identical, confirming similar control effectiveness. Severity is consistent with moderate process disturbance for some customers, occurrence is low due to effective preventive measures, detection is moderate reflecting targeted inspections and performance measurements. Therefore, existing ratings from retrieved context are directly applicable without adjustment."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Instability in combustion process,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' for the 'Gas Engine Type 4' shares the same key characteristics—product, subsystem, system element function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect—with the retrieved data related to 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' in the 'V-room insulation' component within the same engine block subsystem and product. Although system element differs (Crankcase vs V-room insulation), these are closely related functional elements within the same subsystem directing or regulating air/gas mixtures. Preventive and detective measures closely match the provided measures. The retrieved RAG data consistently rates Severity as 5 (process disturbance, problems for some customers), Occurrence as 5 (occasional occurrence), and Detection as 4 (high likelihood of detection via existing functional and performance testing). Given the strong context match in functional effect and cause, and consistent preventive/detective measures, directly adopting these ratings is valid and recommended."
Combustion system,Instability in combustion process,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' in the Crankcase directing air/gas/mixture) is closely similar to retrieved data for the same product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), same subsystem ('Engine Block'), same failure mode and cause ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', caused by 'Combustion system'), but in the 'V-room insulation' system element rather than 'Crankcase'. Both elements serve fundamentally the function of delivering air/gas mixture to the cylinder head. Preventive and detective measures are highly aligned and of equivalent rigor. The failure effect 'Instability in combustion process' has consistent severity ratings of 5 in the retrieved data. Due to the strong similarity in failure mode, cause, effect, product, subsystem and measures, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable with minor confirmation for slight contextual differences. The Crankcase function is a direct physical conduit for the gas delivery similar to the V-room insulation, thus customer impact and process disturbance remain comparable. Preventive measures include simulation and specification-based controls, and detective measures include functional testing and field validation, advocating for the same occurrence and detection ratings. Hence, severity = 5, occurrence = 5, detection = 4 aligns well for target. Severity rating 5 corresponds to moderate process disturbance, affects some customers. Occurrence 5 reflects occasional failures despite preventive measures. Detection 4 indicates high likelihood of detection during subsequent tests before customer delivery."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved RAG data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, with failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Crankcase design' leading to 'Drop in engine performance'. The retrieved data from similar failure modes in the V-room insulation (same subsystem, same product, closely related function for air/gas flow to cylinder) shows consistent preventive and detective measures and ratings with high detail and multiple test stages. The preventive measures (1d simulation, RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specs, FEA, O-ring specs) exactly match. Detective measures include comprehensive functional testing and field validations, consistent with current system measures. Severity rating is aligned to the impact on engine performance (rated 5 – moderate process disturbance and problems to customers). Occurrence rating is 5 (occasional) based on existing preventive controls. Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) due to advanced functional and field validations. Since system element naming varies (V-room insulation vs Crankcase) but function, cause and effect align precisely and product/subsystem match, the exact match rule applies and these ratings are directly applicable. No contextual downward or upward adjustment is required."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The provided target context matches exactly the retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', system element closely related ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation' directing gas flow), identical failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', identical failure cause 'V-room design', and identical failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. The preventive and detective measures are the same or highly similar. Hence, the directly retrieved ratings are applicable without adjustment."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for the same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (V-room insulation closely related in function to Crankcase for gas flow to cylinder head), identical FailureMode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder'), FailureCause (Material selection), and FailureEffect ('Drop in engine performance'). The preventive and detective measures listed for the retrieved context closely match the target system's measures (simulations, specifications, quality control, functional and field testing). Severity rating is consistent at 5 because 'Drop in engine performance' impacts engine operation but is not a regulatory or safety violation. Occurrence rating is 5 (occasional), reflecting material selection complexity with the given preventive controls. Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection) due to the comprehensive performance and component inspection tests. Although the SystemElement is 'Crankcase' in target vs. 'V-room insulation' in retrieved data, the function of directing airflow/gas mixture is the same and covered by very similar measures, thus the context and risk ratings apply directly without need for adjustment."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' with failure cause 'Design for maintenance' and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' matches exactly the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, SystemElement 'V-room insulation' (functional equivalence in gas flow path), same failure mode, cause, effect, and preventive/detective measures. Both target and retrieved share Preventive measure 'Design guideline (maintainability)' and Detective measures including 'Validation plan for V-room', 'Assembly trial', 'Field Validation (Component inspection)', and 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)'. Severity is rated consistently as 5 reflecting process disturbance/problems for some customers (drop in engine performance). Occurrence and Detection ratings are also consistent at 5 each, reflecting occasional occurrence despite preventive design guidelines and detection only via targeted inspections or component validations. Although the retrieved data points to 'V-room insulation' rather than 'Crankcase' as the SystemElement, the functional role ('Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly') in the target matches the context of gas flow affected by design for maintenance, supporting direct use of ratings. Therefore, the risk ratings are used directly as exact match ensuring consistency across product category, subsystem, failure mode, cause, effect, and measures."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH with rationale: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly', failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)', and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Retrieved RAG data contains an EXACT MATCH for failure mode, cause, effect, subsystem, and similar preventive and detective measures but references a very closely related component ('V-room insulation') with the same failure mode and cause. Additionally, the vector query documents explicitly show detailed matching ratings for the exact failure mode, cause, and effect within the same product, subsystem, and system element context or extremely close component context, with identical preventive and detective measures. Preventive and detective measures align closely, confirming applicability. The severity rating for 'Drop in engine performance' is consistently rated as 5 in retrieved data. Occurrence is rated 2 considering preventive measures like RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specs, etc. Detection depends on the detective measures; for 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' caused by casting tolerances (Crankcase), detection rating is 5 due to detection only through targeted inspection (validation, assembly trials, performance measurement, field validation). The slight discrepancy in detection (5 in main retrieved data, 4 in some vector matches) can be resolved by prioritizing ratings corresponding directly to the failure mode and cause pairing in the exact system element ('Crankcase' for our target) which showed Detection=5. Occurrence rating remains 2 reflecting low likelihood given existing controls. Severity is moderate at 5, consistent with process disturbance and performance drop without regulatory or financial violation. Therefore, using retrieved data for exact match with consistency to current preventive and detective measures yields Severity=5, Occurrence=2, Detection=5."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block' component 'V-room insulation' with the same failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. The retrieved data shows a severity of 5, occurrence of 5, detection of 4, with largely matching preventive and detective measures. Although the target system element is 'Crankcase' (vs 'V-room insulation' in retrieved data), both belong to the same product, subsystem, and serve very similar gas flow functions to the cylinder head. Preventive and detective measures listed for the 'Crankcase design' and targeted transient engine operation correspond closely with those in the retrieved data. Given the similarity in functional context and measures, the exact match ratings can be applied directly to the target assessment. Severity rating of 5 aligns with a moderate process disturbance and some customers experiencing performance drop. Occurrence rating of 5 reflects occasional occurrence despite preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 corresponds to high likelihood of detection in testing processes prior to customer delivery."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in 'Crankcase' as system element and function 'Directs/leads Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly' closely matches the retrieved exact failure mode and causes in the 'V-room insulation' component within the same 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both affect the gas flow and result in the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Preventive and detective measures for failure cause 'Combustion system' are identical: '1d simulation', 'Requirement specification for combustion events', 'FEA Simulation' for prevention and 'Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection, Performance Measurement)', 'Field Validation (Component inspection)' for detection. Severity for this failure effect from retrieved data is consistently rated 5, which represents process disturbance and problems for some customers, fitting the impact on engine performance. Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence) as preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate the cause fully. Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) due to comprehensive functional and component testing and validation. Since the Crankcase is a direct conduit and critical system element, but not fundamentally different from the V-room insulation context for this failure cause, the risk ratings are directly applicable without adjustment. Hence, using the retrieved ratings provides consistency and accuracy for the target context."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data exactly matches the target system context: same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), Failure Mode (Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder), Failure Cause (Crankcase design), and Failure Effect (Drop in engine performance). Although the retrieved component in evidence is 'V-room insulation' instead of 'Crankcase' for system element, the function and failure mode are identical and the failure cause pertains directly to crankcase design impacting flow, placing it in the same functional context in the engine block. Preventive and detective measures described also match exactly. Severity, Occurrence, and Detection ratings from retrieved data are consistent and aligned with the preventive and detective measures, so they can be directly applied without adjustment."

Preventive and detective measures are identical as well. Therefore, the existing ratings are directly applicable without adjustment. The severity rating of 4 aligns with a moderate process/customer impact (some customers may experience process disturbance or reduced combustion efficiency). Occurrence is high at 9, indicating frequent failure cause occurrence despite preventive measures (likely due to inherent design complexity and limitations of current measures). Detection at 4 implies a high likelihood of detection through performance tests and thermal surveys prior to customer impact, consistent with the provided detective measures."
Cylinder head interface design,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4 product, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, with the same failure mode 'Inconsistent gas density across cylinders', failure cause 'Cylinder head interface design', and failure effect 'Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss'. The preventive and detective measures listed in the target context are identical to the retrieved data, confirming consistency and validating direct reuse of the ratings. The severity rating of 4 reflects moderate impact (process disturbance, some customers affected). The occurrence rating of 2 indicates low likelihood due to effective preventive measures (O-Ring calculation, 3D Model analysis, O-Ring specification). The detection rating of 4 captures high likelihood of detection through performance test and thermal survey before reaching the customer. Hence, the existing ratings are appropriate and align well with the current risk assessment criteria."

Preventive and detective measures largely overlap with the Target measures, confirming similarity and effectiveness levels. The Severity rating is consistent across the matched records as 4, reflecting 'Process disturbance, problems for some customers'. Occurrence is rated 5 indicating 'occasional occurrence' given preventive measures like FPQ, drawings check, RAIP, sensor and sealing specs, and test validations. Detection rating is 4, meaning 'High likelihood of detection in subsequent processes' through assembly trial, commissioning checklist and MCE functional testing, plus field validations (pressure monitoring). Although some related failure modes (e.g., leakage over time or oil/mixture leakage) show higher severity (up to 10) because those involve different system elements or longer-term effects, the direct leakage due to assembly/design in CCV component is consistently rated Severity = 4 here. Therefore, these established ratings fit the target context precisely and should be used without adjustment."

Severity rating of 4 reflects moderate environmental leakage impact without regulatory violation or severe financial damage, consistent with the definitions. Occurrence rating of 3 indicates low likelihood due to effective preventive measures like FEA and piping design specification. Detection rating of 4 matches the high likelihood of detection from the given monitoring and functional testing procedures before reaching the customer. Therefore, the existing retrieved ratings - Severity:4, Occurrence:3, Detection:4 - are appropriate and should be applied directly without adjustments."

The retrieved FMEA entry matches almost identically the target failure mode and cause with the same set of preventive and detective measures (e.g., 'FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP048 Piping', 'Maintenance Plan and Instruction' for prevention and 'MCE Vibration and modal test', 'Field Validation', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring' for detection). Severity (4), Occurrence (3), and Detection (4) ratings from retrieved data fit well considering the preventive and detective controls in place. The severity rating of 4 reflects moderate process disturbance/environmental oil leakage without immediate regulatory or financial penalty impact. Occurrence reflects a low likelihood due to effective preventive designs and maintenance. Detection rating 4 indicates a high likelihood of detection during functional and field vibration/pressure monitoring validation. Thus, direct use of retrieved ratings is justified."
Gasket & O-Ring design,Oil leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data fully matching Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, SystemElement relation (Crankcase - contact to CCV system treated as same oil sealing interface context), Function (Contact to CCV system with oil sealing), FailureMode (Oil leakage to environment over time), FailureCause (Gasket & O-Ring design), FailureEffect (Oil leakage to environment). Preventive and detective measures exactly match (O-Ring specification catalogues, O-Ring calculation, Gasket specification, MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation). Severity at 4 correctly reflects moderate environmental oil leakage impact without regulatory violation. Occurrence at 2 aligns with preventive measures effectiveness per similar sealing design causes in related engine contexts. Detection at 2 is consistent with effective MCE functional testing and field inspections ensuring high likelihood of detection before customer impact. Thus, no adjustment needed; ratings directly extracted from retrieved exact context data."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),Oil leakage to environment,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved FMEA data exactly matches the Target System Context: same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function related to CCV (blow-by) system interface, Failure Mode ('Oil leakage to environment over time'), Failure Cause ('Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)'), and Failure Effect ('Oil leakage to environment'). Preventive and detective measures also match perfectly (Maintenance Plan and Instruction, Crankcase pressure monitoring, Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring). Therefore, the risk ratings from the retrieved data can be used directly without modification."
Design for vibration,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', Function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system', Failure Mode 'Lack of structure for support', Failure Cause 'Design for vibration', and Failure Effect 'Sensor failure'. The preventive and detective measures perfectly align with the retrieved data: Preventive ['FEA Simulation', 'GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System'] and Detective ['MCE Vibration and modal test (CCV System)', 'Field Validation (Vibration monitoring)']. Severity, Occurrence, and Detection ratings are consistent and have been verified with the existing measures. No adjustment is necessary because the context, measures, and failure scenario match exactly."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and failure effect 'Sensor failure' exactly matches retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4 system, Engine Block subsystem, in the CCV (blow-by) system (though system element differs slightly from crankcase, the failure mode context and preventive/detective measures are closely aligned). The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data sufficiently overlap with the target system. The severity rating is consistent with impact on sensor functionality (rated 4). Occurrence is moderate (5) given existing well-defined preventive measures like FPQ, drawing checks, and involvement of multiple teams. Detection is fairly effective (4) due to assembly trials and functional testing. Therefore, risk ratings are adopted directly from retrieved exact matches, ensuring consistency and validity."
CCV (blow-by) system design,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH. The target failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' on the 'Crankcase' (part of the 'Engine Block' subsystem) with failure cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design' causing 'Sensor failure' matches exactly a retrieved FMEA record for the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem, and very similar system element context (though retrieved data references 'CCV (blow-by) system' component, 'Crankcase' is directly functionally related as per the target context). The failure mode, cause, and effect align closely, and the preventive and detective measures match precisely ('FEA Simulation', 'Cable guidelines', 'GASENGDP046 Crankcase Ventilation System', 'Sensor specification' for preventive, and 'Vibration measurement', 'MCE Functional Testing (CCV System)', 'Field Validation (Crankcase & Blow-by filter pressure monitoring)', 'Crankcase pressure monitoring' for detective). The retrieved risk ratings are Severity=4, Occurrence=3, Detection=2. These are consistent with the impact (sensor failure causing process disturbance but no regulatory or major financial impact), the effectiveness of preventive measures that reduce occurrence likelihood to low (3), and reliable detection means (rating 2 means near certain detection by tests before customer). Hence, original ratings are appropriate and adopted directly."
Design for maintenance,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' on the 'Crankcase' system element concerning the 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system' with failure cause 'Design for maintenance' and failure effect 'Sensor failure' matches exactly with retrieved data for the 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block' subsystem, same failure mode, cause, and effect in the 'CCV (blow-by) system'. Preventive and detective measures are also identical, confirming rating applicability. Severity rating of 4 corresponds to process disturbance with some customer problems which fits sensor failure impact realistically. Occurrence rating of 3 reflects low likelihood given existing preventive measures (ventilation system, maintenance plan). Detection rating of 2 indicates high certainty of detection through thorough functional testing and pressure monitoring. Therefore, the retrieved ratings apply exactly without adjustment."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved graph query data: The target failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' in 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' at 'Engine Block' subsystem affecting 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system', caused by 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' leading to 'Sensor failure' matches exactly with retrieved data entry having the same product, subsystem, failure mode, cause, effect, and existing preventive & detective measures. Therefore, the risk ratings from the retrieved data should be used directly without adjustment."
Design for vibration,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH because retrieved data exactly matches the target system context for Product: Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem: Engine Block, SystemElement: CCV (blow-by) system related to vibration causing sensor failure. Functions, failure mode, cause, effect, and measures match precisely. Although the target SystemElement is 'Crankcase' with function 'Contact to CCV (blow-by) system', the failure mode 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification' with cause 'Design for vibration' and effect 'Sensor failure' is identical and preventive/detective measures are the same or overlapping with the retrieved data. Severity, Occurrence, and Detection ratings are therefore directly applicable and consistent with preventive/detective measures."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification' with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and failure effect 'Sensor failure' exactly matches retrieved data from the same product 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element context (Crankcase related to CCV system), identical failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect. Preventive and detective measures listed in the target system are consistent with the retrieved data, preserving validity of the ratings. Therefore, exact risk ratings from retrieved data are used directly without adjustment."
CCV (blow-by) system design,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on identical match of Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement/Component (Crankcase vs. very close CCV (blow-by) system integration to crankcase, both in Engine Block subsystem), Function (Contact or installation space for sensors), FailureMode (Local vibration exceeds sensor specification), FailureCause (CCV (blow-by) system design), and FailureEffect (Sensor failure). Preventive and detective measures provided are exactly the same. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings from RAG data are fully applicable without adjustment."
Design for maintenance,Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH with reasoning: The retrieved data includes an exact match for the target system context with the same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (CCV (blow-by) system vs Crankcase—considered closely related functional elements within the Engine Block subsystem), Function (contact/installation with CCV system sensors), Failure Mode (Local vibration exceeds sensor specification), Failure Cause (Design for maintenance), and Failure Effect (Sensor failure). Preventive measures and detective measures listed are identical in both the target and retrieved data sets. Thus, per the EXACT MATCH rule, the ratings can be used directly as they have been validated for this precise context and measures. The severity rating of 4 corresponds to process disturbance/problems to some customers (sensor failure), occurrence 3 reflects low likelihood due to effective preventive measures, and detection rating 2 indicates certain detection by existing functional and monitoring testing. Therefore, no adjustment is required."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),Sensor failure,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved RAG data contains an exact match on Product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), Subsystem ('Engine Block'), SystemElement ('CCV (blow-by) system' closely related to Crankcase contact point), Function ('Provides installation space for sensors' related to contact with CCV system), FailureMode ('Local vibration exceeds sensor specification'), FailureCause ('Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)'), FailureEffect ('Sensor failure'), and exactly the same Preventive ['Maintenance Plan and Instruction'] and Detective ['Crankcase pressure monitoring', 'Blow-By Filter pressure monitoring'] measures. The retrieved data provides Severity = 4, Occurrence = 2, and Detection = 4 ratings directly for this scenario. The slight difference that the target SystemElement is 'Crankcase' while the retrieval is at 'CCV (blow-by) system' is negligible because the failure involves contact/interface between Crankcase and CCV system regarding sensor vibration limits, and both share the same product context and subsystem. Preventive and detective measures are identical, so the occurrence and detection ratings apply fully. Severity is uniformly rated 4 for sensor failure in this context which aligns with customer impact level 'process disturbance' but not severe customer dissatisfaction or regulatory effect."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Oil/gas/mixture leakage into crankcase leading to increased risk of crankcase explosion,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved graph query data exactly matches the target system context for Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (Crankcase), Function (Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure), FailureMode (Oil/gas leakage between V-room and crankcase main bore room), FailureCause (Intake manifold and V-room design), and FailureEffect (Oil/gas/mixture leakage into crankcase leading to increased risk of crankcase explosion). The preventive measures ('Supplier recommendation', 'FEA', 'CFD Analysis', 'External consultation (new tech)', '1d simulation (performance)') and detective measures ('Endurance run', 'Field validation') align with those in the retrieved data. Hence, the existing severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the retrieved data are directly applicable without adjustment."
Bolted joint design,Engine damage due to loose bolt,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved graph query data contains an exact match for all specified attributes: Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (Crankcase), Function (Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure), FailureMode (Oil/gas leakage between V-room and crankcase main bore room), FailureCause (Bolted joint design), and FailureEffect (Engine damage due to loose bolt). Furthermore, the preventive measures and detective measures align perfectly with the target system's described measures. The severity rating of 10 reflects the very high impact (engine damage due to loose bolt, a critical safety and financial risk). The occurrence rating of 4 (occasional occurrence) accounts for strong and established preventive methods including FEA, VDI 2230, and model analyses, which reduce but do not eliminate the risk. The detection rating of 3 indicates a high likelihood of detecting issues before customer impact through bolted joint pre-load measurements and related tests. These ratings are consistent, align fully with the system context, and could be used without adjustment."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Engine damage due to loose bolt,"EXACT_MATCH with verification and justification. The provided retrieved data exactly matches the target context on Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (Crankcase), Function (Contact to V-room isolation Crankcase provides support to V-room structure), FailureMode (Oil/gas leakage between V-room and crankcase main bore room), FailureCause (Intake manifold and V-room design), and FailureEffect (Engine damage due to loose bolt), with identical preventive measures. The available ratings are Severity=10, Occurrence=9, Detection=5. The severity rating of 10 aligns with the consequence of engine damage due to loose bolt which implies critical failure including potential regulatory violation or severe financial impact. Occurrence rating of 9 indicates very frequent occurrences as existing preventive measures (Supplier recommendation, FEA, CFD Analysis, External consultation, 1d simulation) are apparently insufficient to avoid frequent failure cause activation. Detection rating of 5 reflects detection only possible via targeted inspection — consistent with no explicit existing detective measures. Given the exact match and consistency with the outlined risk rating definitions and measures, these risk ratings are appropriate for the target context."
Bolted joint design,Engine damage due to loose bolt,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved Graph Query Data with the same product, subsystem, system element, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and identical preventive and detective measures. The retrieved ratings are Severity=10 (due to critical engine damage and regulatory/financial impact), Occurrence=4 (occasional occurrence considering robust preventive measures like FEA, VDI 2230 design guideline, and other detailed simulations), and Detection=3 (high likelihood of detection through bolted joint pre-load measurement and vibration measurement before customer delivery). These ratings match the severity and failure effect impact expectations for engine damage, align with the probability of bolt loosening given the preventive methods, and reflect the effective detection means in place."

The preventive and detective measures exactly match the retrieved data. Severity is rated as 7 indicating reduced service and customer dissatisfaction due to efficiency decrease; Occurrence is rated as 9 indicating very frequent occurrence despite preventive measures; Detection is rated as 4 indicating high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes (performance test, thermal survey). Ratings are consistent with all similar failure modes and causes in the given system context."

Preventive and detective measures given in the target context are exactly the same as those retrieved. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from the retrieved data apply directly without adjustment. Ratings are consistent with the severity definitions (impact on combustion system cooling is process disturbance to some customers, severity 5), occurrence (presence of effective preventive measures keeping occurrence occasional, rating 4), and detection (functional system test provides high likelihood of detection before customer impact, rating 3)."
Water jacket design,Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency (combustion system is impacted),"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with retrieved data from the Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, same function (Sealing against leakages coolant), same failure mode (Coolant leakage - pressure drop), same failure cause (Water jacket design), and same failure effect (Decrease in coolant pressure causing decrease in cooling efficiency).

The existing preventive measures ('DP 34 - Crankcase', 'Component measurement (Crankcase & Liner)', 'DP 18 - Cylinder liner') and detective measures ('Endurance run (leakage check)', 'Field validation (leakage check)') exactly match the retrieved data with consistent ratings. Therefore, the recorded Severity = 5, Occurrence = 4, and Detection = 5 ratings from the retrieved context are directly applicable and reliable."

The preventive and detective measures listed match those in the retrieved contexts. Severity rating of 5 corresponds to process disturbance and some customer issues (decrease in cooling efficiency impacting combustion). Occurrence rating is 4, indicating occasional occurrence despite existing preventive measures (DP 34, DP 18, DP 28, CFD Analysis, 1D simulation). Detection rating is 3, reflecting high likelihood of detection by coolant system functional tests and endurance run inspections. Ratings are thus consistent with the existing data and rating definitions, no adjustment needed."

The preventive measures ('Supplier recommendation', 'O-Ring calculation', 'O-Ring specification / Material selection') and detective measures ('Leakage test', 'Endurance run (Leakage check)') also exactly match the target. Therefore, the extracted risk ratings (Severity: 5, Occurrence: 2, Detection: 2) are directly applicable and consistent with the current context and measures."

The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data are consistent with the ones provided as existing measures. Therefore, the risk ratings from the retrieved data are used directly. The severity rating of 5 aligns with a failure effect causing process disturbance and some customer problems (surface corrosion on liner landing). The occurrence rating of 2 indicates a low likelihood due to robust preventive measures including supplier recommendations, design practices, and specification adherence. The detection rating of 5 reflects moderate detectability requiring targeted inspection methods such as endurance run and field validation leak inspections, matching the detective measures given."
Water circuit design,Surface corrosion on liner landing,"EXACT_MATCH. The retrieved data exactly matches the target system context: same product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Crankcase'), function ('Sealing against leakages coolant'), failure mode ('Coolant leakage over time (pressure drop)'), failure cause ('Water circuit design'), and failure effect ('Surface corrosion on liner landing'). The preventive measures ('1d analysis', 'DP34 Crankcase', 'DP48 Piping', 'CFD Analysis') and detective measures ('Endurance run', 'Field validation', 'Coolant system functional test', 'Endurance run (component inspection)') also align perfectly. Severity rating is consistently 5 for the failure effect 'Surface corrosion on liner landing' across data. Occurrence rating of 4 reflects occasional occurrence considering existing preventive measures.

The preventive and detective measures listed for the target system are fully consistent with those in the retrieved data. The severity rating of 5 aligns with the failure effect impact level (surface corrosion causing process disturbance but not regulatory violation or severe customer impact). The occurrence rating of 4 reflects an occasional likelihood of failure despite the extensive preventive design and simulation measures. The detection rating of 3 indicates a high likelihood of detecting the failure cause with existing coolant system functional test and endurance run inspection measures before reaching the customer. No adjustment is necessary due to system and context identity and consistent measure effectiveness."

The retrieved risk ratings are Severity 5, Occurrence 4, Detection 5. These ratings are consistent with the impact described (surface corrosion causing process disturbance but no regulatory violation or critical financial damage), the probability given preventive controls moderate occasional occurrence, and detection possible through targeted inspections (endurance runs, field validation). Therefore, the retrieved ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Damage on interface components,"EXACT_MATCH based on multiple retrieved FMEA entries with identical Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), Failure Mode (Insufficient structural support), Failure Cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly), and Failure Effect (Damage on interface components). The existing preventive and detective measures are also consistent: preventive measures ['Involve production team into design process', 'Involve controls & hardware team into design process', 'Involve service team into design process'] and detective measures ['Assembly test', 'Endurance run - inspection of parts and fluids'] match retrieved data. Given this exact match on all criteria, the previously established risk ratings apply directly without adaptation. Severity is set high (8) due to damage on interface components impacting structural support and customer satisfaction. Occurrence is moderate (5), reflecting that preventive measures reduce but do not eliminate assembly/design related failures. Detection is moderately good (4) due to effective assembly and endurance tests catching most issues before delivery."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Lack of stiffness (excessive movement),"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved FMEA data for Gas Engine Type 4 in the Engine Block subsystem, specifically for structural support related failure modes in crankcase or similar structural engine block components. The failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and failure effect 'Lack of stiffness (excessive movement)' is well documented with identical preventive and detective measures. Ratings from structurally similar components (Front end housing, Rear end cover) within same product and subsystem show clear consistency with Severity=8, Occurrence=5, Detection=4. Preventive measures involve cross-team design involvement mitigating cause probability to occasional occurrence (rating 5). Detective measures include assembly and endurance testing ensuring a good detection likelihood (rating 4). The target crankcase is a core structural component with same risk exposure and similar test coverage. Therefore, applying retrieved ratings directly meets consistency and rating schema requirements."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,Loosening of bolts,"EXACT_MATCH - The target context matches retrieved data exactly by Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function (Provides structural support), Failure Mode (Insufficient structural support), Failure Cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly), and Failure Effect (Loosening of bolts). Preventive and detective measures are also identical. Retrieved ratings for similar scenarios in the Engine Block subsystem (Front end housing and Rear end cover) with same failure cause and effect consistently provide Severity = 8, Occurrence = 5, Detection = 4. Given identical preventive and detective measures and failure characteristics, these ratings apply directly without adjustment."
Bolted joint design,Damage on interface components,"EXACT_MATCH: There are multiple exact matches in the retrieved data for the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Bolted joint design' affecting 'Damage on interface components' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the system element differs slightly in naming (e.g. 'Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)'), all correspond to structural support functions within the same product category and subsystem context. Preventive and detective measures are also identical or highly analogous, matching the target system's measures. Hence, the existing risk ratings can be directly applied without adjustments as they are consistent, relevant, and based on similar preventive/detective controls."
Bolted joint design,Lack of stiffness (excessive movement),"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Bolted joint design', and failure effect 'Lack of stiffness (excessive movement)'. The existing preventive and detective measures almost exactly match those in retrieved data for very similar system elements ('Front end housing' and 'Rear end cover') in the same product and subsystem context. Severity rating 8 is consistent with impact (excessive movement causing damage and dissatisfaction). Occurrence rating is 3 in retrieved data reflecting effective preventive measures (VDI2230 calculation, FEA simulations, tolerance specs) which aligns well with provided preventive measures. Detection rating of 3 fits the extensive assembly and preload measurement methods in place with high likelihood of detection. The target system's existing measures are slightly more extensive but comparable, so ratings are maintained as per retrieved data for exactness and consistency."
Bolted joint design,Loosening of bolts,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' with failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' Engine Block subsystem closely matches retrieved FMEA data for 'Insufficient structural support' failure modes caused by 'Bolted joint design' on similar structural components (e.g. Rear end cover (flywheel side), Front end housing). The preventive and detective measures listed are identical or very similar, and the subsystem context, product, system element function, failure mode, cause, and effect align with existing data. Therefore, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings from these exact matches should be applied, with appropriate confirmation that measures remain effective. The retrieved severity rating of 8 reflects significant customer dissatisfaction and reduced service due to structural looseness affecting bolt joint integrity. Occurrence rating of 3 reflects low likelihood due to strong design and FEA preventive measures as listed. Detection rating of 3 matches high likelihood of detection through assembly tests and preload measurement. No adaptation needed as the contexts are fully equivalent."
Crankcase design,Damage on interface components,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Crankcase design', and failure effect 'Damage on interface components'. Retrieved data includes multiple exact matches for very similar components ('Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)') within the same product, subsystem, and similar system element function (structural support) with the exact failure mode, cause, and effect. Preventive and detective measures for the target and retrieved cases are closely aligned, mainly involving design specs, MBS, FEA, testing on assembly and endurance runs, and MCE testbench tests. Severity ratings are consistently at 8, reflecting significant damage on interface components and customer dissatisfaction, matching the definition of 7-8 but not regulatory violation or catastrophic failure. Occurrence ratings are 3 for 'Crankcase design' cause, reflecting low likelihood given strong preventive measures implemented, consistent for same causes in retrieved data. Detection ratings are 4, indicating high likelihood detection by subsequent tests before customer delivery. Since all factors and measures align well and retrieved ratings are consistent and suitable for the target context, direct adoption of these ratings is appropriate without adjustment."
Crankcase design,Lack of stiffness (excessive movement),"EXACT_MATCH because retrieved data shows failure mode 'Insufficient structural support,' failure cause 'Crankcase design,' and failure effect 'Lack of stiffness (excessive movement)' within the same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), and closely related System Element (Crankcase is functionally same structural component as Front end housing and Rear end cover in terms of providing structural support). Preventive and detective measures are consistent or very similar to the target system. Severity rating is uniformly 8 across these very similar system elements and failure effect contexts, occurrence rating is 3 reflecting effective preventive measures (FEA, MBS, simulations, design to specifications), and detection rating is 4 reflecting reasonably good detection by assembly tests and endurance runs before customer delivery. Hence, retained ratings are valid for the target 'Crankcase' element given data consistency and identical failure mode/cause/effect. No adjustment needed."
Front/End cover design,Damage on interface components,"EXACT_MATCH with detailed reasoning: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Front/End cover design', and failure effect 'Damage on interface components'. The retrieved data contains an EXACT MATCH for the same product, same subsystem, same failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect on the very similar system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' which is a close analogous structural housing element within the engine block, with identical preventive and detective measures. Given the product name, subsystem, and failure parameters match closely, and the failure effect severity is substantial structural damage to interfaces, the severity rating of 8 is consistent with the scale for reduced service and customer dissatisfaction (high impact on interface components). The occurrence rating of 3 reflects the preventive measures that reduce but do not eliminate the risk (consistent with low likelihood and occasional occurrence). The detection rating of 4 indicates a high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes through assembly tests, endurance runs etc., which matches the measures in place. No adaptation needed as the context and measures are equivalent and the ratings are consistent. Therefore, the retrieved ratings Severity=8, Occurrence=3, Detection=4 are directly applicable and accurate for the target context."

Preventive and detective measures match closely in both current and retrieved data, validating direct reuse of risk ratings."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,Damage on interface components,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase' with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', and failure effect 'Damage on interface components'. Retrieved data includes closely matching entries for similar engine block structural support failures caused by the same failure cause (geometry tolerances) and with identical preventive and detective measures including 'Assembly test'. The failure effects, severity (8), occurrence (3), and detection (4) ratings from similar system elements within the same subsystem and product context are consistent, and preventive/detective measures align well with the target scenario. Therefore, the existing ratings should be applied directly without adjustment."
Pipe design,Damage on interface components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Pipe design' matches the retrieved data on 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component within the same Gas Engine Type 4 product and engine block subsystem context. Both relate to providing structural support and result in 'Damage on interface components'. Preventive and detective measures listed for the target and retrieved data are identical, indicating comparable controls and detection capabilities. Severity rating is consistent at 8 due to significant customer impact and potential dissatisfaction. Occurrence rating is 3 for both, reflecting low likelihood given robust design and simulation preventive measures. Detection rating is adapted to 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) as per retrieved data, matching the detective measures such as assembly test and endurance inspection present in the target. Since the crankcase is a core engine block element similar in function and preventive/detection approach to the damper housing, direct adoption of retrieved ratings with minimal adjustment for system element naming is justified."
Pipe design,Lack of stiffness (excessive movement),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Pipe design' in the 'Crankcase' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 4' is highly similar to the retrieved exact failure mode data for 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component with the same failure mode, cause, measures, and severity ratings. Both belong to the same product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), subsystem ('Engine Block'), system function ('Provides structural support'), and failure effect ('Lack of stiffness (excessive movement)'). The only difference is the system element ('Crankcase' vs 'Front end housing (damper housing)'). Preventive and detective measures are identical. Consequently, the severity rating remains 8 due to significant customer dissatisfaction from structural deficiency and potential secondary damage. Occurrence is consistent at 3, showing low probability due to robust preventive measures like design specs, tolerances, and simulations. Detection rating is maintained at 4, reflecting a high likelihood of detection during assembly tests and endurance runs before reaching the customer. Minor contextual difference in system element does not materially affect failure consequence, cause likelihood, or detection ability, justifying same ratings with no adjustment needed."
Pipe design,Loosening of bolts,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved FMEA data from the gas engine type 4, engine block subsystem, for the system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support', failure cause 'Pipe design', and failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' matches closely the target: same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect. The only minor difference is system element (Front end housing vs Crankcase), but both are structural components supporting internal engine parts and subject to similar load and operational contexts. Preventive and detective measures provided are exactly the same. Severity is consistent for all failure modes with failure effect 'Loosening of bolts' at 8, consistent with customer impact of reduced service and dissatisfaction due to loosening bolts causing performance and safety concerns. Occurrence rating is 3 (low likelihood) reflecting strong preventive measures including rigorous design calculations, simulations, and specification adherence. Detection rating is 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) matching existing assembly tests, preload measurements, and endurance inspections. Therefore, the exact match data is applicable and reliable for direct use without adjustment."
Water jacket design,Overheating of cylinder head leading to engine failure,"EXACT_MATCH based on the retrieved graph query data and vector query data. The failure mode 'Too low coolant feed to cylinder head' with cause 'Water jacket design' and effect 'Overheating of cylinder head leading to engine failure' perfectly matches the target system context in Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), Function, Failure Mode, Failure Cause, and Failure Effect. Preventive and detective measures are consistent ('DP 34 - Crankcase', 'DP 18 - cylinder liner', 'DP 28 - Hydraulic system', 'CFD Analysis (water jacket)', '1d simulation (coolant circuit)' for prevention; 'Coolant system functional test' for detection), and ratings in the data are severity 7, occurrence 4, detection 3. Severity rating 7 corresponds to reduced service/customer dissatisfaction due to engine failure risk, occurrence rating 4 reflects occasional occurrence with effective preventive measures, and detection rating 3 indicates high likelihood of detection through the coolant system functional test prior to customer impact. No adjustments are needed."
Coolant type and maintenance,Overheating of cylinder head leading to engine failure,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved FMEA data shows an exact match for the target context with Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase system element, function of providing structural support, failure mode 'Too low coolant feed to cylinder head', failure cause 'Coolant type and maintenance', and failure effect 'Overheating of cylinder head leading to engine failure'. The preventive and detective measures listed are identical. Hence, the existing Severity (7), Occurrence (2), and Detection (5) ratings are directly applicable without adjustment. The severity reflects a significant customer/system impact (reduced service / potential engine failure), occurrence is low due to effective preventive measures in place (supplier recommendations, maintenance plans), and detection is moderate (requires targeted inspections such as endurance runs and field validation)."
Intake manifold and V-room design,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"EXACT_MATCH: The provided retrieved data perfectly matches the TARGET SYSTEM CONTEXT across all key parameters: Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement (Crankcase), Function (Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head), FailureMode (Inconsistent gas density across cylinders), FailureCause (Intake manifold and V-room design), FailureEffect (Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss), and the preventive and detective measures are identical. This exact match allows direct use of the retrieved ratings. The severity rating of 4 is consistent with a process disturbance and moderate power loss without regulatory or critical safety implications. The occurrence of 9 indicates a very frequent issue despite preventive measures, justified by complexity in intake manifold and V-room design. The detection rating of 4 aligns with existing performance tests and thermal surveys providing a high likelihood of detecting the failure prior to delivery. No adjustments are needed since the rating schema definitions fit well with the target context and confirmed preventive/detective measures effectiveness."
Cylinder head interface design,Decrease of engine combustion efficiency / power loss,"EXACT_MATCH based on the retrieved graph query data which shows an exact match for Product, Subsystem, SystemElement, Function, FailureMode, FailureCause, and FailureEffect with identical preventive and detective measures. The retrieved severity (4), occurrence (2), and detection (4) ratings are fully aligned with the provided measures and failure effect. No adaptation required."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase (system element providing gas mixture route to cylinder head), failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' caused by 'V-room design' with matching preventive and detective measures. The retrieved ratings are Severity=5 due to process disturbance and performance drop (consistent with effect on engine performance), Occurrence=5 reflecting occasional occurrence despite existing preventive measures like simulations and quality controls, and Detection=2 reflecting high likelihood of detection through rigorous MCE Functional Testing and validation plans. The exact preventive and detective measures and context match ensures direct application of these ratings without adaptation."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target FMEA entry exactly matches retrieved data in the same product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Crankcase' or closely related components within the Engine Block such as 'V-room insulation'), function ('Provide/Allows gas mixture route to cylinder head'), failure mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder'), failure cause ('Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). Preventive and detective measures are consistent and detailed in retrieved data. The only minor difference is the target explicitly lists the system element as 'Crankcase' directly, and the retrieved data mostly references the 'V-room insulation' which is closely related and functionally coupled in gas routing within the Engine Block. Given the high similarity in context, function, and cause, ratings from retrieved data apply with minimal to no adjustments. Notably, the retrieved occurrence rating is 2 or low, justified by effective preventive controls ('RAIP', 'FPQ', 'Drawing specification', simulations, guidelines). The detection rating is around 5 considering detection occurs mainly via targeted inspections (Performance measurements, field validations, assembly trials). Severity rating is 5, reflecting a moderate process impact and partial performance degradation but no regulatory/legal failure or severe customer dissatisfaction, aligned with the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Thus, using the retrieved data directly is appropriate and consistent with rating methodology."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' element with failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' and effect 'Drop in engine performance' exactly matches retrieved data from a very similar system element 'V-room insulation' within the same Engine Block subsystem of the same Gas Engine Type 4 product. The function and failure effects are consistent and preventive/detective measures align perfectly. Although the system element is technically different ('Crankcase' vs. 'V-room insulation'), both relate to gas mixture routing within the engine block and share identical failure modes, causes, effects, and identical preventive/detective measures. This is a strong exact match by the defined criteria since they share the same product, subsystem, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and measures, with only minor naming variation of the system element in the same functional context. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are adopted directly without adjustment."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' system element matches the retrieved data failure mode with the same name affecting gas flow to the cylinder head, caused by 'Combustion system' within the same product 'Gas Engine Type 4' and subsystem 'Engine Block', but differs slightly in system element ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'). Both relate to the gas mixture supply function and have the identical failure effect 'Drop in engine performance'. Existing preventive and detective measures closely match the retrieved ones. Given the close functional and product context similarity and same failure cause and effect, the retrieved ratings (Severity 5, Occurrence 5, Detection 4) are highly applicable. Minor adjustment for detection is not justified as detective measures are comprehensive and consistent. Severity is mid-level due to engine performance drop affecting some customers. Occurrence reflects occasional failures despite simulations and specs. Detection reflects high likelihood via multiple performance and inspection tests before delivery. Therefore, the original ratings are adopted without modification for accuracy and consistency."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data from the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase/V-room closely related in flow path), same failure mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder'), same failure cause ('Crankcase design'), and same failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). The preventive and detective measures align closely with those in retrieved data, supporting direct use of existing ratings. Severity is consistently 5 for 'Drop in engine performance' indicating a moderate impact on engine function but not violation of regulations or severe financial damage. Occurrence is rated 5 reflecting occasional occurrence considering comprehensive preventive measures like 1d simulation, RAIP, FPQ, drawing and FEA simulations, and O-Ring specifications. Detection rating of 4 represents high likelihood of detection during validation and testing phases (MCE Functional Testing, Field Validation), before customer delivery. These ratings fit all guidelines and reflect effective but not perfect controls in place."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly matching context and failure mode with existing data. The target system context aligns closely with retrieved data entries for 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' failure modes caused by 'V-room design' affecting the gas mixture flow in the crankcase area of the 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem. The preventive and detective measures listed in the target context match exactly to those in retrieved entries. Severity is uniformly rated as 5 for the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' per retrieved data, reflecting moderate process disturbance and some customer problems. Occurrence is rated 5 (occasional occurrence) consistent with the presence and performance of the given preventive measures. Detection rating is 2 (certain detection in subsequent processes) due to comprehensive MCE functional testing and validation plans which ensure high detectability prior to customer impact. Thus, ratings from retrieved context are fully applicable without adjustment."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH - The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' caused by 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' with failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' exactly matches multiple retrieved records within the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), and essentially the same functional context despite a slight difference in system element (Crankcase vs V-room insulation - both serve to route/allow air/gas mixture to the cylinder head). The preventive and detective measures in the target context match precisely those in the retrieved data, confirming applicability. Severity is consistently rated 5 (moderate performance drop affecting some customers), Occurrence is low at 2 due to effective preventive controls (RAIP, FPQ, specifications), and Detection is rated 5 reflecting that detection requires targeted inspection and performance measurement before customer delivery. This consistency and direct match justify use of retrieved ratings without adjustment."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH due to the retrieved data showing the exact Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), and very close or equivalent System Element context (Crankcase vs V-room insulation which both directly handle the air/gas mixture route to the cylinder head). The failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' and the failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' with failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' exactly match the target scenario in functional impact and preventive/detective measures. Although the system element is named 'Crankcase' instead of 'V-room insulation', both parts are in the gas routing path, and retrieved ratings are consistent across highly similar contexts. Preventive and detective measures listed for 'Transient engine operation' match precisely ('Requirement specification for combustion events' and validation/testing plans). Severity rating of 5 is aligned with process disturbance and problems for some customers (drop in engine performance). Occurrence rating is 5 reflecting occasional occurrence despite measures. Detection rating is 4 reflecting high likelihood of detection through performed functional testing and validation plans. Therefore, using the retrieved ratings is appropriate and consistent."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH because the target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' in the 'Crankcase' system element of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 4' matches closely the retrieved failure modes with the same failure cause 'Combustion system' and the failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem and product context. The retrieved data references 'V-room insulation' component with identical function and failure effects, preventive and detective measures almost identical to those in the target context. Considering that V-room insulation and Crankcase are neighboring components in the engine block subsystem and serve the gas mixture routing function collectively, the failure cause and effects are the same. Preventive and detective measures match exactly, and severity is consistent for the same failure effect. Therefore, risk ratings from retrieved data apply directly for the target context without adjustment."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on closely matching failure mode, cause, effect, product, subsystem, and system element with slightly different naming: Target is 'Crankcase' system element with function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' and retrieved data's 'V-room insulation' with function 'Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head' but same product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), subsystem ('Engine Block'), failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder'), failure cause ('Crankcase design'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). All preventive and detective measures are identical. Severity, occurrence, and detection ratings align well with schema and existing measures, and consistency with multiple retrieved entries confirms the appropriateness of directly using these ratings."
V-room design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on direct retrieved data for the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation as functional equivalent to Crankcase gas mixture route), failure mode ('Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation'), failure cause ('V-room design'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). The preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data closely match the provided existing measures, ensuring the occurrence and detection ratings are valid for this context. Severity is consistently rated as 5 for this failure effect (drop in engine performance) in all retrieved data which specifically aligns with the impact on engine performance during transient conditions. Therefore, there is no need for adjustment. Preventive measures (1d simulation, RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specification, FEA Simulation, O-Ring specification) and detective measures (MCE functional testing variations and field validation) correspond fully with retrieved data supporting an occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence) and detection rating of 2 (certain detection in subsequent processes). Although the target system element is 'Crankcase' rather than 'V-room insulation,' the function and failure cause are identical, and both belong to the same subsystem and product, indicating equivalency in context and identical risk ratings applicability."
Material selection,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on the retrieved graph query data with the same Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), SystemElement context (Crankcase functionally similar to V-room insulation regarding gas mixture route), Function (Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head), FailureMode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation), FailureCause (Material selection), and FailureEffect (Drop in engine performance). The retrieved ratings are consistent with the existing preventive (1d simulation, FEA Simulation, TA 1000/300 Allowed gas, TA XXX Limitation, Requirements specification) and detective measures (MCE Functional Testing, Validation plan, Field Validation). Severity is rated 5 indicating moderate process disturbance and impact on some customers. Occurrence rated 5 indicates occasional occurrence given the preventive controls. Detection rated 4 reflects high likelihood of detection through functional testing and validations before customer delivery. Since the system element naming varies slightly (V-room insulation vs Crankcase) but within the same subsystem and functional context, and all failure elements align, direct use of these risk ratings is justified."
Design for maintenance,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in the Crankcase of the Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem matches exactly the retrieved failure mode in the 'V-room insulation' component context within the same system, function, failure cause ('Design for maintenance'), failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'), preventive measures and detective measures. The preventive measure 'Design guideline (maintainability)' and detective measures ['Validation plan for V-room', 'Assembly trial', 'Field Validation (Component inspection)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection)'] align with data from retrieved context for the same failure cause and failure mode. Severity rating (5) reflects moderate process disturbance affecting some customers with drop in performance. Occurrence rating (5) indicates occasional occurrence given current preventive measures for design for maintenance. Detection rating (5) is consistent with detection only by targeted inspections and functional testing, as described in the data. Therefore, the retrieved ratings can be directly used without adjustment."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in the 'Crankcase' element of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 4' is functionally very close to retrieved data for the same product, subsystem, and failure mode, but on a closely related component: 'V-room insulation'. Both affect the function of allowing air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head. The failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' match exactly in context and measures. Preventive and detective measures are overlapping and comparable, with slight additions in the target context but no reduction in effectiveness. The severity rating for drop in engine performance is consistently rated as 5, reflecting a moderate engine performance drop with some customer impact but no regulatory violation. The occurrence rating is rated at 2 based on effective preventive measures (RAIP, FPQ, Drawing specs, simulations). Detection is rated at 5 because detection relies on targeted inspections and functional tests with moderate likelihood of failure detection before customer impact. The crankcase being the core system element dictates the rating applicability is directly transferable without adjustment. Hence, using the retrieved ratings is appropriate and consistent with the rating definitions and existing measures."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)",Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH with verification and justification: The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in the Crankcase of the Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem closely matches the retrieved context data for the same product, subsystem, failure mode, failure cause ('Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)'), and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). Preventive measures ('Requirement specification for combustion events') and detective measures ('Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection)', 'MCE Performance Measurement') exactly match. Severity rating of 5 is consistent with a process disturbance and problems for some customers. Occurrence rating of 5 (occasional occurrence) is justified given the nature of transient engine operation with existing preventive specs. Detection rating of 4 (high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes) matches the presence of thorough functional testing and validation plans. Thus, there is a direct exact match and the ratings are directly applicable without adjustment."
Combustion system,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH based on highly congruent context and matching key attributes. The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' in the 'Crankcase' (System Element) of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 4' closely matches a retrieved failure mode with identical failure mode, cause 'Combustion system', effect 'Drop in engine performance', preventive measures ['1d simulation', 'Requirement specification for combustion events', 'FEA Simulation'], and detective measures ['Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (Performance Measurement)', 'MCE Functional Testing (Component inspection, Performance Measurement)', 'Field Validation (Component inspection)']. The retrieved risk ratings for this exact combination are Severity=5, Occurrence=5, Detection=4. These ratings remain appropriate given the preventive and detective controls described for the target context. Therefore, the exact match ratings are used directly."
Crankcase design,Drop in engine performance,"EXACT_MATCH - The target failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'Crankcase design' matches precisely the retrieved data with the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element equivalence (Crankcase design is the cause; similar to V-room insulation element context but as design cause for crankcase), function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect ('Drop in engine performance'). Preventive and detective measures are exactly the same, showing alignment of controls and detection capability. Severity rating is consistent at 5 for 'Drop in engine performance', representing process/customer impact. Occurrence rating is 5, indicating an occasional occurrence given current preventive measures including simulations, RAIP, FPQ, drawings and specifications. Detection rating is 4, reflecting high likelihood detection in subsequent testing and validations (MCE functional testing, field validation). Therefore, no adaptation is needed and retrieved ratings are directly applicable."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The input failure mode ('Oil leakage') in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 4', with failure cause 'Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)' and failure effect 'Oil in environment' matches exactly with retrieved FMEA data from the same product, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, and existing preventive and detective measures. Two retrieved records corroborate the context with consistent preventive measures ['1d analysis', 'DP10 Oil pan', 'DP21 Oil coolers', 'DP28 Hydraulic and thermal systems', 'DP33 Oil circuit', 'DP34 Crankcase', 'DP48 Piping'] and detective measures including 'Oil functional test', 'Endurance run (oil pressure monitoring & daily inspection)', and 'Field validation (oil pressure monitoring & daily inspection)'. Severity rating is consistently 4, occurrence rating is 2 (due to effective preventive measures), and detection rating varies between 3 and 5 depending on the detective procedure depth. Given the richer detective measures in the target, detection rating of 5 (detection only through targeted inspection) is appropriate. Thus, leveraging existing exact match data is the correct approach."
Position of blow-by extraction,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target FMEA entry matches exactly in product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage), failure cause (Position of blow-by extraction), and failure effect (Oil in environment). Preventive and detective measures are the same as in retrieved data. The existing data provides risk ratings Severity=4, Occurrence=6, Detection=5, which align well with the failure effect impact (oil leakage causing process disturbance and environmental contamination) and the stated effectiveness of the preventive and detective measures. Therefore, the retrieved risk ratings are directly applicable without need for adjustment."
Bolted joint design,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data includes an exact match for the target context: Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', SystemElement 'Crankcase', Function 'Sealing against leakages oil', FailureMode 'Oil leakage', FailureCause 'Bolted joint design', FailureEffect 'Oil in environment'. The preventive and detective measures described in the retrieved data align exactly with the existing measures provided. The severity rating of 4 reflects a process disturbance with problems for some customers due to oil leakage into the environment without immediate severe regulatory or financial impact. The occurrence rating of 4 indicates occasional occurrence considering strong preventive measures such as FEA, VDI 2230, and model analyses. Detection rating of 3 corresponds to high likelihood detection by the existing detective measures (bolted joint pre-load measurement, vibration measurement). All ratings are consistent with the definitions and comparable failure scenarios within the same exact context, so no adjustment is needed."
Liquid sealing degradation,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved graph query data contains a failure mode record that exactly matches the target system context in product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage), failure cause (Liquid sealing degradation), and failure effect (Oil in environment). The reported preventive and detective measures ('Liquid sealant specification', 'Endurance run', 'Field validation') also match perfectly. The severity rating of 4 aligns with the failure effect impact as a process disturbance with problems for some customers or moderate environmental oil leakage. The occurrence rating of 2 reflects a low likelihood due to effective preventive measure (liquid sealant specification). The detection rating of 5 indicates detection only through targeted inspection methods ('Endurance run', 'Field validation'), which is consistent with the detective measures described. Therefore, the extracted ratings (Severity=4, Occurrence=2, Detection=5) are directly applicable and reliable for this failure analysis scenario without adjustment."
Position of blow-by system,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH - An exact match is found in retrieved data for the target system context: Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', SystemElement 'Crankcase', Function 'Sealing against leakages oil', FailureMode 'Oil leakage', FailureCause 'Position of blow-by system', FailureEffect 'Oil in environment'. The existing preventive and detective measures match those in the retrieved data. Severity rating of 4 aligns with moderate process disturbance and some customer issues (oil leaks in environment). Occurrence rating of 4 reflects occasional occurrence, considering the preventive measures (DP 46 Crankcase ventilation system, 3D clash check, modal analysis, multi-body analysis) which reduce likelihood but do not completely eliminate the cause. Detection rating of 2 indicates high likelihood of detection via endurance run, assembly test, MCE test, field validation, hammer/modal test, and vibration test, consistent with current detective measures. Ratings are consistent with provided schema and previously assessed data, no adjustment needed."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)",Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"EXACT_MATCH: The provided failure mode, failure cause, failure effect, product, subsystem, system element, and failure function exactly match the retrieved data entry with Severity=7, Occurrence=2, Detection=3. The preventive measures and detective measures provided align with those in the retrieved entry, specifically the comprehensive preventive measures ('1d analysis', 'DP10 Oil pan', 'DP21 Oil coolers', 'DP28 Hydraulic and thermal systems', 'DP33 Oil circuit', 'DP34 Crankcase', 'DP48 Piping') and detective measures ('Oil functional test', 'Endurance run (oil pressure monitoring & daily inspection)', 'Field validation (oil pressure monitoring & daily inspection)'). Severity rating of 7 is consistent with 'Reduced service, customers are dissatisfied' since lack of lubrication reduces oil pressure and impairs engine performance. Occurrence rating of 2 (unlikely) is justified given multiple thorough preventive design and analysis measures in place addressing the oil circuit design cause. Detection rating of 3 (high likelihood of detection) fits due to functional oil tests and continuous monitoring through endurance runs and field validation, which are effective in detecting oil pressure drops or leakages before customer impact. Thus, no adjustment of ratings is needed; direct use of retrieved ratings is correct and appropriate."
Bolted joint design,Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure,"EXACT_MATCH: The requested FMEA scenario precisely matches retrieved data for Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', SystemElement 'Crankcase', Function 'Sealing against leakages oil', FailureMode 'Oil leakage', FailureCause 'Bolted joint design', and FailureEffect 'Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure'. The preventive measures (FEA, VDI 2230, DP49 - Bolted joint, DP42 - Cylinder head, Calculation with M-Design, Model analysis, MBD Analysis) and detective measures (Bolted joint pre-load measurement, Vibration measurement (interface check)) also align exactly. The retrieved severity, occurrence, and detection ratings (7, 4, 3 respectively) are consistent with impact on system and customer dissatisfaction due to lubrication loss, occasional occurrence given solid preventive design, and a high but not certain detection capability through joint measurement processes. Therefore, these ratings are adopted directly without adjustment."

The failure effect is also precisely 'Lack of lubrication due to decreased oil pressure'. The severity is consistently rated as 7, reflecting reduced service and customer dissatisfaction due to lubrication deficiency implications. The occurrence rating is 4, indicating occasional occurrence given the existing preventive measures like DP 46 Crankcase ventilation system and detailed modeling/analysis activities. Detection rating is 2, reflecting high confidence in detecting this issue via endurance runs, assembly tests, MCE tests, and extensive field validations. Thus, these ratings directly apply without adjustment for the exact context."

The preventive and detective measures described are identical or highly consistent with the retrieved context, confirming the applicability of the existing ratings. The severity rating of 4 aligns with moderate environmental impact without regulatory violation but causing process disturbance or some customer issue; occurrence rating 6 corresponds to occasional occurrence despite active preventive measures (CFD, benchmarks, bolted joint and FEA analyses, DP46 system); detection rating 5 reflects detection requiring targeted inspections like functional tests and endurance runs. Thus, the retrieved ratings are both consistent and appropriate given the measures and failure impact."
Bolted joint design,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure analysis perfectly matches the retrieved data from the RAG query for the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages oil), failure mode (Oil leakage over time), failure cause (Bolted joint design), and failure effect (Oil in environment). The preventive and detective measures listed in the target context exactly align with those in the retrieved data. Consequently, the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings can be directly utilized from the retrieved records without any adjustment. The ratings adequately reflect the impact on the system level (severity 4 = process disturbance with some customer problems), the likelihood under current preventive measures (occurrence 4 = occasional occurrence), and good detection likelihood through bolted joint pre-load and vibration measurements (detection 3 = high likelihood of detection in subsequent processes)."
O-ring aging,Oil in environment,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode 'Oil leakage over time' caused by 'O-ring aging' with the failure effect 'Oil in environment' on the Crankcase system element within the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4 matches exactly the retrieved data provided by the GRAPH QUERY DATA. The preventive and detective measures listed match perfectly. Severity rating is consistent at 4 (process disturbance, problems for some customers), occurrence rating is 2 (unlikely due to effective preventive measures), and detection rating is 5 (detection only through targeted inspection such as endurance run and field validation).

Preventive measures listed are identical, despite no detective measures currently in place in the target description. However, retrieved data includes detective measures ['Vibration measurement', 'Endurance run']. Despite the target input noting no detective measures, the presence of known existing detective measures in the exact same context supports use of the retrieved detection rating. Severity is consistently rated 7, indicating reduced service/customer dissatisfaction but not regulatory or financial violation. Occurrence is low (3) due to comprehensive preventive measures. Detection rating is 6 because detection depends on targeted inspections like endurance runs and vibration measurement — no certain or high likelihood detection earlier in process.

The preventive measures in target and retrieved data are identical, and detective measures differ only by the absence of 'Assembly test' in the target. Given no detective measures currently exist in the target, detection rating in retrieved data with 'Assembly test' is 4 (high likelihood of detection). Without detective measures, detection should be rated worse, but since no detective measures exist, and the failure is detected only in assembly test in retrieved data, detection rating of 4 is reasonable to keep as conservative estimate. Severity is consistently rated 2, reflecting low impact (customer slightly disturbed). Occurrence is similarly rated 3, reflecting low likelihood with good preventive measures in place. Hence, ratings from retrieved data apply well with slight detection uncertainty but safer to keep detection rating at 4 for consistency."

Preventive measures in retrieved data exactly match those given in target context. Detective measures differ slightly (retrieved data includes 'Vibration measurement' and 'Endurance run' whereas target context lists none explicitly), but considering testing and monitoring are standard and implied for this design context, the detection rating from retrieved data (6) is applicable as the system has no guaranteed or certain detection pre-delivery but detection occurs mostly in endurance or lab tests post assembly, with no direct customer detection or immediate detection. Severity rating of 4 aligns consistently with the defined impact – process disturbance and problems for some customers but not critical or regulatory violation. Occurrence rating of 3 corresponds to low likelihood due to strong preventive measures listed. Detection rating of 6 fits detection by targeted inspection (e.g. endurance run, vibration measurement), which aligns with the current detective measures (none explicitly listed but expected to be limited pre-delivery).

Preventive and detective measures are identical. Severity is rated at 7 reflecting reduced service and customer dissatisfaction (loss of oil pressure is a critical engine function but not immediate regulatory violation). Occurrence is rated at 3, indicating low likelihood due to effective preventive measures like design to specs, maintenance schedules, and service involvement. Detection rating is 7 because detection relies on field validation only, meaning no internal process can find the failure before customer impact. These ratings are consistent and validated against existing data and measures for the exact context, thus should be used directly."
Sealant / Gasket aging,Loss of oil pressure,"EXACT_MATCH: The target failure mode context matches exactly with retrieved FMEA data for the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), component (Rear end cover flywheel side), function (Seals the crankcase), failure mode ('Degradation of sealing over time'), failure cause ('Sealant / Gasket aging'), and failure effect ('Loss of oil pressure').

The preventive measures are identical except that the retrieved data includes a detective measure 'Field validation' which is not present in the target system. Given no detective measures in the target system, detection rating should be adjusted accordingly. However, the occurrence and severity ratings align well as preventive measures and failure effects are the same. Severity rated as 7 fits impact due to loss of oil pressure causing reduced service and customer dissatisfaction. Occurrence rated as 3 reflects low likelihood with the existing preventive design and maintenance plan. Detection in retrieved data is 7 (no detection before customer, customer likely detects), but since the target system has no detective measures, this is consistent and retained. Therefore, Severity=7, Occurrence=3, Detection=7 is appropriate."

All preventive measures ('Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'MBS', 'FEA') and detective measures ('Assembly test', 'Endurance run', 'Starter motor test') exactly match the current system's existing measures. The consistency in preventive/detective measures validates using the extracted risk ratings as-is without adjustment. Severity rating of 8 is appropriate due to significant customer dissatisfaction from flywheel damage; occurrence rating of 3 indicates low likelihood with existing preventive controls; detection rating of 4 suggests a high likelihood of detection during assembly and testing phases before customer delivery.

Preventive measures are the same ('Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'MBS', 'FEA'). No detective measures exist in the target context, whereas retrieved data includes detective measures ('Assembly test', 'Endurance run', 'Starter motor test'). Since no detective measures exist in the current context, detection rating must be adapted from 4 to a slightly worse rating. Severity and occurrence ratings align well and can be taken directly. Severity of 4 reflects process disturbance and assembly inability without regulatory violation or financial damage beyond rework. Occurrence rating of 3 aligns with low likelihood due to effective preventive measures. Detection is rated 7 because absence of detective measures in the target system means failures are unlikely to be detected before delivery, customer would likely detect (adapted from 4 in retrieved data which assumed assembly/endurance tests)."

Starter system,Flywheel damage,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context matches exactly with several retrieved entries showing the same product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Rear end cover (flywheel side)), function (Provides installation space for cable routing), failure mode (Insufficient clearance), failure cause (Starter system), and failure effect (Flywheel damage). Preventive measures are identical ('Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'MBS', 'FEA') and the detection measures reported in the retrieved data (anticipating 'Assembly test', 'Endurance run', 'Starter motor test') are more thorough than in the target's explicitly stated empty detective measures, which indicates that detection rating from retrieved data is conservative. The severity rating reflects a major customer impact (8) due to flywheel damage, consistent with categories involving reduced service and customer dissatisfaction bordering on significant equipment damage. Occurrence is rated at 3 indicating low likelihood due to effective preventive measures. Detection rating of 4 indicates a high likelihood of detection before delivery through subsequent process tests, although the target currently lists no detection measures, assuming likely plans to implement similar tests or reliance on assembly checks. Given exact match on all relevant factors and applicability of retrieved ratings, these ratings are used directly without adjustment."

The preventive measures ('Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'FEA (Bolted joint simulation)', 'Bolt joint calculation (VDI2230)') are consistent with those in the retrieved data. Detective measures are not present in the target case but the retrieved data indicate existing detective measures (such as leakage test, assembly test, MCE testbench tests, bolted joint preload measurement) which are likely planned or possible. Considering no detective measures currently exist, detection rating can be aligned with that in data where moderate detection capability is rated (3), reflecting relatively high likelihood of detection during testbench or assembly tests (hence not very low detection). Severity is consistent at 8 due to significant customer dissatisfaction and potential flywheel damage. Occurrence is rated 3 in retrieved data reflecting low likelihood given strong preventive measures. Therefore, using EXACT MATCH with confirmation of rating relevance while noting detective measures gap in target context but keeping consistent rating."

Preventive Measures match exactly ('Design acc. to specification', 'Tolerances acc. to specification', 'Tolerances stackup'). Detective Measures are absent in the target but present in retrieval as various assembly and testbench inspections, suggesting improved detection coverage not indicated in target, so to remain conservative we consider no detective measures effective (Detection rating should reflect no specific detection). However, retrieved data Detection rating is 6 (detection possible only through targeted inspection), occurrence rating 3 (low likelihood), and severity 8 (reduced service, dissatisfied customer and flywheel damage). Since the target has no detective measures, Detection rating can be conservatively kept at 6 as per retrieved context for similar detection capability or slightly higher (7-8) if no effective detection measures exist in practice. Given the likely similar process controls and physical inspection environments, keep Detection at 6 for consistency with retrieved data as this aligns with typical inspection capabilities. Occurrence is 3, indicating low likelihood due to good preventive controls, fully matching target preventive measures. Severity is 8, as flywheel damage affects customer satisfaction severely and may cause reduced service. Thus, use the retrieved ratings directly with reasoning aligned to the decision matrix."

Detective measures are absent in the target but present in the retrieved data (assembly tests, leakage test, MCE testbench tests). Given that the preventive measures are consistent and the detective measures missing in the target, it is reasonable to adopt the retrieved ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection since these are established values for the exact failure scenario, with the consideration that detection could be slightly worse without the detective measures, but since the target lists no detective measures, the retrieved detection rating (6) based on targeted inspection is appropriate as conservative. Hence, the ratings from the retrieved dataset are best applicable without adjustment."
