Assembly process deficiencies including misalignment and improper bolted joint implementation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', failure mode 'Leakage to crankcase exterior' caused by 'Assembly process deficiencies including misalignment and improper bolted joint implementation'. The retrieved data includes a closely similar failure mode 'Leakage crankcase (outside)' on 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' Engine Block subsystem with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)'. Although the product type differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), the system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause are highly comparable within the same product category of gas engines and within the same subsystem and component. Measures related to assembly process deficiencies including alignment and bolted joint issues are applicable and technically sensible to transfer. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are adapted from this closely similar context and used accordingly."

Although the exact product type differs (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the failure cause and mode combination in the Engine Block subsystem for PCJ is closely similar and measures are directly transferable and applicable. Measures related to O-Ring aging, bolted joint design/fatigue, and corrosion from the retrieved data for 'Leakage crankcase (outside) over time' and associated sealing degradation failure modes are appropriate and technically consistent with FMEA standards."
"Crankcase design inadequacies, geometry tolerance deviations, and machining out-of-specification","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', failure mode 'Internal leakage of oil inside crankcase' caused by 'Crankcase design inadequacies, geometry tolerance deviations, and machining out-of-specification'. Retrieved context includes 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', and the same failure mode 'Leakage of oil inside crankcase' (equivalent to internal leakage) with very similar causes: 'Crankcase design', 'Geometry tolerances', and 'Not machined to spec' (matching machining out-of-spec). Thus, preventive and detective measures from this closely matching context are applicable and valid for transfer to the target context."
"O-Ring aging, gasket sealant aging, corrosion due to engine room humidity, incorrect maintenance planning, and bolted joint design flaws","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element Piston Cooling Jet (PCJ), function sealing of main oil gallery, failure mode degradation of sealing over time, caused by O-Ring aging, gasket sealant aging, corrosion due to engine room humidity, incorrect maintenance planning, and bolted joint design flaws. In the retrieved data, multiple closely matching failure modes 'Degradation of sealing over time' or related sealing degradation/failure causes occur in Engine Block subsystems of Gas Engine Type 4, in components functionally similar or related to sealing of oil galleries or crankcase sealing. The failure causes including O-Ring aging, Sealant/Gasket aging/design, Corrosion due to humidity, Wrong maintenance plans, and Bolted joint design flaws have documented preventive and detective measures applicable by similarity. These measures are technically valid for the target system context given the same system element function and failure mode cause nature, despite a slightly different gas engine type. Therefore, measures are transferred as per SIMILAR_CONTEXT decision, using terms and data from the retrieved context without invention."
"Improper bolted joint design, misalignment during assembly, incorrect geometry tolerances, and non-compliant machining","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode 'Insufficient sealing due to design or assembly errors' of the piston cooling jet sealing the main oil gallery. Retrieved data contains related failure causes including 'Bolted joint design', 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', and 'Crankcase design' causing sealing failures, oil leakage, and degradation in Gas Engine Type 4 and related engine block elements. Although not an exact match on the system element (piston cooling jet vs. V-room insulation, rear end cover etc.) or product generation (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the failure modes and causes share the sealing function and sealing failures due to design and assembly errors in the engine block subsystem with bolted joints and geometry tolerances as key causes. The measures are applicable and transferable with naming variations. Therefore, relevant preventive and detective measures for bolted joint design, assembly process, geometry tolerances, and machining tolerances are adopted from the context for use in the target context."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data is from a different product variant ('Gas Engine Type 4' vs 'Gas Engine Type 6') but matches exactly in Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), Function (Opens at a desired opening pressure), Failure Mode (Not opening at the desired pressure), and Failure Cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)).

The failure cause 'Check-Valve design' for 'Not opening at the desired pressure' in 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' is present in the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Measures regarding oil circuit analysis and component/system testing are relevant and applicable. No additional new measures outside retrieved context were added, per requirements."
Check-Valve wear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', function 'Opens at a desired opening pressure', failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure' and failure cause 'Check-Valve wear'. Retrieved context provides measures for the EXACT same System Element, Function, Failure Mode, and Failure Cause in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' product with identical subsystem and very similar system context. Because it is the same subsystem and element with a different engine type (Type 4 to Type 6) within the same product category (gas engine), the measures from Type 4 are applicable with naming variations. Therefore, the preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context are valid and applicable without modification."
Cleanliness,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 and retrieved data mostly comes from Gas Engine Type 4, but subsystem, system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function, failure mode (Not opening at the desired pressure), and failure cause (Cleanliness) match exactly. Product category is the same (gas engines), so measures are transferable and applicable."
Geometry tolerances,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target product is Gas Engine Type 6 while retrieved data is for Gas Engine Type 4, but the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Opens at a desired opening pressure), failure mode (Not opening at the desired pressure), and failure cause (Geometry tolerances) are the same. The product category (gas engines) is similar, so measures for this failure cause and mode are transferable and applicable."
Not machined to spec,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The retrieved data matches the target subsystem (Engine Block), system element identity (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), function (Opens at a desired opening pressure), failure mode (Not opening at the desired pressure), and failure cause (Not machined to spec) exactly but for a different product (Gas Engine Type 4 vs. Gas Engine Type 6). Given the same product category (Gas Engine) and highly similar technical context, the measures are transferable and applicable to the target system context. The retrieved data explicitly contains Preventive and Detective measures for this exact failure cause and failure mode, so these are used without modification."
Nozzle holder,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs in product version but shares the same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', function, failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure', and failure cause 'Nozzle holder' as found in retrieved data predominantly from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Measures from the same system element and failure cause and mode are applicable and logically transferable, given technical consistency in function and design similarities within the same product category (gas engines)."
Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved context data is mainly from 'Gas Engine Type 4' which is a similar gas engine product category and uses the same subsystem 'Engine Block', the same system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', same function, failure mode 'Not opening at the desired pressure' and same failure cause 'Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system'. This matches exactly on system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause but differs on product version. Measures for this failure cause and failure mode in the retrieved context are directly applicable and sensible for the target system context. Therefore, we transfer the preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context without modifications."
Vibration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' matches exactly in subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause with data available from 'Gas Engine Type 4' (same product category: gas engines). While the exact product differs, the system, element, function, failure mode, and failure cause are identical, thus preventive and detective measures can be transferred. Only context-relevant measures specifically tied to vibration causing the PCJ not to open at desired pressure are used. Measures related to vibration and design or assembly improvements from retrieved data relevant to piston cooling jet and vibration are included, especially FEA Modal Analysis (preventive) and Hammer/Modal test (detective) which are the direct measures specifically for PCJ failure by vibration in Engine Block. Additional generic vibration-related design and assembly preventive measures from similar failure cause 'Vibration' in engine block components are not repeated because that would exceed the scope of only context-specific measures for PCJ vibration-caused failure. Hence, the final output includes only the exact-match preventive measure 'FEA Modal Analysis' and detective measure 'Hammer/Modal test' to avoid creating measures beyond retrieved context."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same product category (Gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), same failure mode (Closes not at the desired pressure), and same failure cause (Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)). Although the function is worded slightly differently ('Opens at a desired opening pressure' vs. 'Close at the desired pressure (minimize hysteresis)'), the failure mode and cause are the same, and the preventive and detective measures related to assembly/design for assembly are applicable. Thus, measures from the exact failure mode and failure cause in the retrieved data are transferable and relevant."
Carbon deposit from oil,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), Function: Opens at a desired opening pressure, Failure Mode: Closes not at the desired pressure, Failure Cause: Carbon deposit from oil) matches closely with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same subsystem, system element, similar function, identical failure mode and failure cause.

The function description is slightly different in wording but functionally equivalent regarding pressure behavior. Both belong to the automotive/gas engine product category and have sufficient context similarity to transfer measures. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are transferred and verified as relevant for 'Gas Engine Type 6'."
Check-Valve wear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and retrieved context data 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' with the exact function 'Opens at a desired opening pressure', failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' and failure cause 'Check-Valve wear'.

Although the exact product differs (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the product category (gas engines), subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, failure cause, and failure effect are the same or equivalent in context. The minor difference in product type still falls under the same product category and functional context, allowing direct transfer of preventive and detective measures from retrieved data. The function phrasing differs slightly ('Opens at a desired opening pressure' vs. 'Close at the desired pressure (minimize hysteresis)'), but the failure behavior and cause are aligned (pressure-related closing function affected by cleanliness). Hence, SIMILAR_CONTEXT is justified with direct use of retrieved measures."
Geometry tolerances,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target Gas Engine Type 6 with Engine Block subsystem and Piston cooling jet (PCJ) system element shares the same System Element, Function, Failure Mode, and Failure Cause (geometry tolerances causing the valve closing not at the desired pressure causing oil flow fluctuation) as retrieved context from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Piston cooling jet (PCJ). Functions differ slightly in wording but equivalent (Open vs Close at desired pressure), thus preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 context are applicable and transferred."
Not machined to spec,"EXACT_MATCH because the context matches exactly: same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), same function (Opens at a desired opening pressure), failure mode (Closes not at the desired pressure) and failure cause (Not machined to spec) as in the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Piston cooling jet (PCJ), with the same failure mode and failure cause."
Nozzle holder,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data 'Gas Engine Type 4' both belong to the same product category (gas engines) with identical subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Piston cooling jet (PCJ)), failure mode ('Closes not at the desired pressure'), failure cause ('Nozzle holder'), and failure effect ('Fluctuation of the oil flow rate to the piston'). The only minor discrepancy is a slightly differing function wording ('Opens at a desired opening pressure' vs. 'Close at the desired pressure (minimize hysteresis)') which is functionally equivalent in the PCJ operation context. Hence, the measures are directly transferable and applicable without modification."
Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' with function 'Opens at a desired opening pressure' and failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure' caused by 'Pressure fluctuation from the lubrication system'. Retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem and system element, same failure mode and failure cause but function slightly differs in wording ('Close at desired pressure (minimize hysteresis)'). Given the very close system context, system element identity, and identical failure mode and failure cause, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data are technically applicable and valid to transfer. Measures focus on pressure fluctuation impact on PCJ operation which relates logically to the function of opening at desired pressure as well."
Vibration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)', failure mode 'Closes not at the desired pressure', and failure cause 'Vibration' does not have an exact match in the retrieved data; however, highly similar context exists from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same subsystem and system element, same failure mode and failure cause vibration. Preventive and detective measures related to vibration effects on piston cooling jets or closely related components within the engine block are applicable and transferable with minor name or specification adaptations. The failure cause 'Vibration' corresponds strongly to general vibration-related preventive practices (FEA Modal Analysis) and detective practices (Hammer/Modal test) seen in exact context, plus additional broader vibration-related design and test measures applicable from engine block elements prone to vibration such as crankcase or bolted joints."
"Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly (alignment, bolted joint)' and failure mode 'Too little oil' in the 'Piston cooling jet (PCJ)' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in a Gas Engine Type 6 is contextually equivalent to data retrieved for Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem and system element with very similar failure mode and cause.

The product differs but remains within the same product category (gas engines). The system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause are directly comparable; thus, measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are applicable with no contradictions or specificity limitations. Preventive measures specifically from exact matches exist for failure cause 'Geometry tolerances' for 'Too little oil' failure mode on PCJ, though detective measures were recorded as None. However, closely related data for similar failure causes and modes in engine blocks indicate relevant detective testing is MCE Functional Testing (Component Inspection). Applicable preventive measures from RAG for this failure cause include 'FPQ' and 'Component test rig'. No detective measures for the same failure mode and cause except a relevant functional testing listed. Therefore, based on exact and similar data applicability within the same product category and subsystem, these measures are recommended without adding any unverified or heuristic measures."

Therefore, preventive and detective measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are applicable and transferable after validation. The failure cause 'Crankcase design' appears in the retrieved data with preventive measures for similar failure mode 'No oil' and failure effects related to piston seizure or oil loss. Some detective measures are linked to specific failure mode combinations like leakage or oil pressure loss but given the close similarity of failure cause and failure mode, these detective measures are suitable, especially functional testing that monitors oil pressure and piston thermal condition to detect oil absence due to crankcase design issues."

Measures for 'Gas Engine Type 4' are relevant and applicable for 'Gas Engine Type 6' within the same product category (gas engines)."
Deposit build up (oil),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' whereas the retrieved data is for 'Gas Engine Type 4' but all other context elements including Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Cylinder liner assembly', Function 'Provide structural support to APR', Failure Mode 'High THC emissions over time', and Failure Cause 'Deposit build up (oil)' exactly match. Given these are same product category and very similar system context, the preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data are applicable and sensible to transfer."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context relates to 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Cylinder liner assembly', with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Assembly process / Design for assembly'. Retrieved contexts include exact failure cause and similar failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' but in other engine block components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover) of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. These have matching failure cause and similar functional roles related to structural support in engine block subsystems within the same product category. Measures for the failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' in the exact failure mode context 'Insufficient structural support' are applicable with proper naming adaptation. Thus, preventive and detective measures from those contexts can be transferred and applied to target system."
Bolted joint design,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to mismatch in failure mode and failure cause context. The target system context is Gas Engine Type 6, Subsystem Engine Block, System Element Cylinder liner assembly, with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Bolted joint design'. The retrieved context data is for Gas Engine Type 4 (different product version) and mostly involves failure modes related to 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Degradation of sealing', 'Blow-by leakage', or 'Insufficient structural support' but in different system elements such as 'Front end housing', 'Rear end cover', 'V-room insulation', and 'Crankcase'. There is no exact or similar context match for Cylinder liner assembly with failure mode Insufficient structural support caused by Bolted joint design. The closest similar data with 'Bolted joint design' causing 'Insufficient structural support' is for other engine block components in Gas Engine Type 4, but since the system element and exact function differ significantly (Cylinder liner assembly vs. other parts), applying measures from those contexts risks technical inaccuracy. Therefore, no measures can be generated based on the retrieved data."
Crankcase design affecting liner assembly support,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Cylinder liner assembly in Engine Block subsystem, failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Crankcase design affecting liner assembly support' with effect 'Loosening of bolts') closely matches context data for gas engines (Gas Engine Type 4) involving Cylinder liner assembly or related Engine Block components with failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' or 'Insufficient contact between liner and crankcase', both having crankcase design as a cause. Although the failure mode and exact system element name differs slightly, the function (structural support) and failure cause (crankcase design) align well. Therefore, preventive and detective measures for the failure cause 'Crankcase design' related to structural support and liner assembly from Gas Engine Type 4 are transferable and appropriate to apply here."
Front/End cover design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Cylinder liner assembly' with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Front/End cover design' does not have an exact context match in retrieved data.

The system element differs (cylinder liner assembly vs front end housing), but they belong to the same product category (gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), the failure cause and failure mode are the same, and the failure effect (damage on interface components) is closely related. The preventive and detective measures on front/end cover design for insufficient structural support are transferable and applicable with naming variations and adapted focus on structural design and testing of cover elements. Hence, SIMILAR_CONTEXT is applicable and retrieved measures can be used."

The function and component name vary but relate to providing structural support and affected by geometry tolerances as failure cause. Hence, preventive and detective measures for this failure cause and failure mode in a similar engine block structural support element are applicable and transferable with verification of context suitability for structural components under engine block subsystem."
Pipe design affecting mounting and support,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Pipe design affecting mounting and support' in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' is highly similar to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' concerning failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Pipe design' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' in the same subsystem. Both address structural support issues due to pipe design affecting mounting and support leading to loosening of bolts or structural inadequacy. Although the system element is named differently, the system element identity (structural support interface with piping) and functional context align well. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from this similar context are applicable and directly transferable after validating technical relevance."
Bolted joint design flaws leading to insufficient sealing force or uneven load distribution,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Bolted joint design flaws' leading to insufficient sealing force or uneven load distribution in the 'Cylinder liner assembly' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches the failure cause 'Bolted joint design' with the failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' in 'V-room insulation' of 'Engine Block' subsystem in Gas Engine Type 4 and also appears in related failure modes like 'Oil leakage' or 'Degradation of sealing over time'. Although the exact failure mode differs (Leakage of combustion gases vs. Oil/Mixture leakage), the root cause of bolted joint design impact on sealing is closely analogous in the engine block subsystem context and product category. Therefore, preventive and detective measures applicable to bolted joint design flaws in engine block sealing components can be transferred and are relevant here."

These contexts are similar enough within the same product category (gas engines) and system element (cylinder liner assembly), subsystem (engine block), and failure mode (combustion gas leakage), just a slight variant in failure cause naming linked to maintenance. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures for 'Wrong maintenance' or 'Wrong maintenance activity plan' causing sealing degradation can be transferred and applied here, ensuring relevance and technical accuracy."

Therefore, preventive and detective measures applicable to Type 4 are transferable and relevant to Type 6."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the retrieved data relates to Gas Engine Type 4 and target is Gas Engine Type 6 (same product category), subsystem Engine Block and system element Cylinder liner assembly match exactly, failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' matches exactly, but the function differs: retrieved context shows 'Containment of combustion gases' while target is 'Absorption of piston loads'. Despite functional difference, the failure cause and failure mode are the same and associated preventive/detective measures for geometry tolerance issues can be transferred and are applicable given the close system element and failure mode context."
Honing structure of liner,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly', failure mode 'Too much oil on the liner', and failure cause 'Honing structure of liner' matches exactly in system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause with retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the product differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), they belong to the same product category (Gas Engine) and use the same subsystem and system element function, thus relevant preventive and detective measures are applicable and transferable without creating new measures. Measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' retrieved data are coherent and appropriate for 'Gas Engine Type 6'."
Wear of liner honing structure,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' while retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', but subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode (Too much oil on the liner) and failure cause (Wear of liner honing structure) match exactly or are considered equivalent. Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines), and measures are transferable and applicable without naming conflicts."

Although the product differs by type number, the product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause align exactly, making the context sufficiently similar. Measures retrieved from 'Gas Engine Type 4' are applicable and technically valid for 'Gas Engine Type 6'. No new measures beyond those in retrieved data are introduced."
Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly, failure mode 'Too much oil on the liner', failure cause 'Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance)') matches system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause from Gas Engine Type 4 data, though the product version differs (Type 4 vs Type 6). Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and the subsystem and system element are identical, making measures transferable and applicable after verification. The failure cause is specifically documented in Type 4 data with corresponding preventive and detective measures that are relevant technically and contextually."
Honing structure of liner,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' whereas retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', but subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function, failure mode ('Too much oil on the liner'), and failure cause ('Honing structure of liner') match exactly. Both are in the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem, with same failure cause and mode. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable to the target system without modification."

Measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable with naming variations allowed."
Oil type and maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly', failure mode 'Too much oil on the liner', and failure cause 'Oil type and maintenance' matching retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Measures from the retrieved data for this exact combination (except product variant) are fully applicable with no contradictions and fit the product category and subsystem context."
Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly', failure mode 'Too much oil on the liner', and failure cause 'Misalignment of PCJ (assembly and maintenance)' exactly matches the system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause from retrieved data of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Though the product type differs slightly (Type 6 vs. Type 4), they fall within the same product category 'Gas Engine' and have identical context for the failure cause and failure mode involving the crankcase and PCJ misalignment. Therefore, applicable measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' can be transferred. No new or unrelated measures are introduced, and all preventive and detective measures are valid in this context."
Honing structure of liner,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) differs in product version from the retrieved context (Gas Engine Type 4), but subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly), failure mode (Too little oil on the liner), and failure cause (Honing structure of liner) match exactly. Measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable since both belong to the same product category and functional context, and the failure cause is the same. No new or unrelated measures are added beyond the retrieved context."

The product differs slightly (Type 6 vs Type 4), but both are gas engines in the same product category and share the same functional and failure context. Hence, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable and sensible to transfer."
Oil type and maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the exact subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Crankcase'), function ('Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly'), failure mode ('Too little oil on the liner'), and failure cause ('Oil type and maintenance') with the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the product type differs (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the product category and key context are very similar and measures related to oil type and maintenance are applicable without modification. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the Gas Engine Type 4 context are transferred as they remain relevant and technically consistent for the target system."
Thermal boundary conditions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved context is from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. All other parameters (Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Crankcase, Function: Directs/leads oil to cylinder liner assembly, Failure Mode: Too little oil on the liner, Failure Cause: Thermal boundary conditions) match exactly except the product version. Measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable to Gas Engine Type 6 as both belong to the same product category and have the same system context. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are transferred accordingly."
Oil type and maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads oil to lubrication system', failure mode 'Too little oil flow' and failure cause 'Oil type and maintenance'. The retrieved data perfectly matches the failure cause and failure mode for the system element 'Crankcase' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' which is in the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block). Measures provided for Gas Engine Type 4 are thus applicable with naming variations allowed, ensuring technical relevance. Limited naming difference in product type (Type 4 vs. Type 6) allows transferability of measures with no technical inconsistencies."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is a gas engine in the same product category and shares the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to lubrication system), failure mode ('Too little oil flow'), and failure cause ('Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)') as the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the product variant differs (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the context is sufficiently similar to transfer measures directly related to the failure cause without modification. The preventive and detective measures retrieved from the exact failure mode and cause in Type 4 engines are applicable and technically sensible for the Type 6 engine as well."
"Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs in product version from retrieved context 'Gas Engine Type 4', but subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads oil to lubrication system), failure mode (Cleanliness not given), and failure cause (Oil circuit design (Diameter, length, etc.)) match. Both belong to the same product category (Gas engines) and subsystem context, making preventive and detective measures transferable and applicable."
Oil type and maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' matches the function, failure mode ('High concentration of oil in gas mixture') and failure cause ('Oil type and maintenance') exactly as in the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the product version differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode and failure cause are the same, making the context highly similar and the measures transferable without conflict or ambiguity."
Thermal boundary conditions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' which differs from the retrieved matches with 'Gas Engine Type 4', but all other context parameters (Subsystem: Engine Block, System Element: Crankcase, Function: Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV system, Failure Mode: High concentration of oil in gas mixture, Failure Cause: Thermal boundary conditions) match exactly. Both systems belong to the same product category (gas engine) with similar subsystem and component context. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context are applicable and technically reasonable to transfer."
Position of blow-by extraction,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function directing oil-gas mixture to CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode 'High concentration of oil in gas mixture', failure cause 'Position of blow-by extraction'. The retrieved context data matches exactly on system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause but from Gas Engine Type 4 instead of Type 6, same product category and subsystem context. Therefore, measures can be transferred with verification of applicability. The failure cause's preventive and detective measures remain technically valid for the similar Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 with failure in Crankcase directing oil-gas mixture to CCV system causing leakage of blow-by gas due to assembly process/design for assembly. Retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 subsystem Engine Block with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and failure mode of leakage of blow-by gas. Although system element differs (Crankcase vs. CCV system), function (directing blow-by gas from crankcase to CCV) and failure causes/modes are equivalent in product category (gas engines) and subsystem (engine block). Naming variations and functional similarity justify transferring applicable measures directly related to assembly process/design for assembly failure cause for leakage of blow-by gas in engine block related to blow-by gas leakage."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' while the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', but the subsystem is the same (Engine Block), and the system element 'Crankcase' function concerning blow-by gas leakage relates closely to the 'CCV (blow-by) system' in the context of crankcase design as failure cause. The failure cause 'Crankcase design' and failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' are similar and applicable. The preventive and detective measures from the closely related failure mode and cause in Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable to Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase context regarding blow-by gas leakage as the designs are conceptually similar, only differing by engine generation/version."
CCV (blow-by) system design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context is for Gas Engine Type 6 with Subsystem Engine Block and System Element Crankcase with function to direct/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system. The retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem Engine Block, but system element is mainly CCV (blow-by) system, function is directing blow-by gas, and failure mode and cause match (leakage of blow-by gas and CCV system design). The difference is that target focuses on Crankcase element instead of CCV system element explicitly, but functionally this is closely related and measures for CCV (blow-by) system design failure cause are applicable and sensible to transfer to Crankcase as they relate to containment and directing of blow-by gas. Therefore, SIMILAR_CONTEXT applies and measures can be transferred with verification."
Piping design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Piping design' causing 'Leakage of blow-by gas' in the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block is not an exact match to retrieved data (which mostly concerns 'CCV (blow-by) system' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'), but it is the same system element identity (piping related to blow-by gas flow), same subsystem (Engine Block), same failure mode and cause, within the same product category (gas engines). The measures retrieved for 'CCV (blow-by) system' and 'Engine Block', for 'Leakage of blow-by gas' caused by 'Piping design' are applicable and technically sensible to transfer."
Gasket & O-Ring design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with 'Engine Block' subsystem and 'Crankcase' element, function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas' and cause 'Gasket & O-Ring design'. Retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with very similar subsystem and functional aspects but uses 'CCV (blow-by) system' as system element instead of 'Crankcase'. The failure cause and mode match exactly, and product category, subsystem, system element identity (related to crankcase ventilation path), and functional purpose are very similar. Measures related to 'Gasket & O-Ring design' causing similar failure mode in 'Leakage of blow-by gas' on crankcase related components in Gas Engines are applicable here. Naming variations matter but do not invalidate similarity. Hence, applicable preventive and detective measures are transferred from the retrieved similar context and adjusted to the target context where relevant."
O-Ring aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure cause 'O-Ring aging' causing leakage of blow-by gas over time in the 'Crankcase' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6' (target) is contextually similar to multiple retrieved records for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem affecting sealing functions (CCV system and crankcase) with failure mode related to blow-by or sealing degradation caused by O-Ring aging. Although the product version and exact system element name vary slightly (Crankcase vs. CCV system or Rear end cover), the function and failure cause are essentially the same within the same product category and subsystem. Hence, directly transferable preventive and detective measures are generated based on applicable data from Gas Engine Type 4 for O-Ring aging in blow-by or sealing leakage failure modes. No exact match for product Type 6 is found, but transfer from very similar system elements and functional failures in the same product category is valid."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT based on same System Element (Crankcase), Subsystem (Engine Block), Function (Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system), Failure Mode (Leakage of blow-by gas over time, similar to Leakage of blow-by gas over time in CCV blow-by system), and Failure Cause (Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)) in Gas Engine Type 4 applied to Gas Engine Type 6. Measures from Gas Engine Type 4 CCV system failure modes and causes are applicable given the close functional relationship and cause similarity, despite slight difference in System Element naming. Measures remain technically valid and appropriate for the target context."
Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and subsystem 'Engine Block' match the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' sharing the same subsystem and a closely related system element function (Crankcase directing/leading Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system vs. CCV system itself). The failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' with the failure cause 'Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.)' is equivalent or highly similar contextually. Thus, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 for the same failure mode and cause can be transferred considering technical applicability in the engine block subsystem for the crankcase directing oil-gas mixture to the blow-by system."
Design for vibration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the system element 'Crankcase' and the failure cause 'Design for vibration' with failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' from 'Gas Engine Type 6' in subsystem 'Engine Block' partially matches the retrieved context data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with closely related failure modes and causes (especially those related to vibration effects on the CCV (blow-by) system and crankcase). Despite slight naming/function differences between 'Crankcase' and the 'CCV (blow-by) system', the failure cause and effect align well, so applicable preventive and detective measures are transferred with verification of applicability."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function relates to directing oil-gas mixture to CCV system, failure mode is disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time, and failure cause is 'Assembly process / Design for assembly'. The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'CCV (blow-by) system', with same failure mode and cause, within the same product category (gas engines) and closely related elements and functions. Measures for 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' for disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time are applicable and technically reasonable to transfer to the crankcase directing flow. No exact target element data found, but similar context applies and measures are suitable."
Intake system (Gas mixer),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) has the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element function context (Crankcase directing oil-gas mixture to CCV system), identical failure mode (Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time), and identical failure cause (Intake system (Gas mixer)) as retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 for the CCV (blow-by) system. The system element name differs (Crankcase vs CCV system), but functionally similar (flow path to CCV related system). Measures from the CCV (blow-by) system in the same subsystem and product category are applicable and transferable given the technical similarity of flow path disturbance caused by the intake system on crankcase pressure. Thus, appropriate preventive and detective measures are transferred and adapted."
Gear train,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase directing oil-gas mixture to the CCV system, with failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' caused by 'Gear train'. Retrieved context shows highly similar failure modes and causes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the Engine Block subsystem, but associated with the CCV (blow-by) system element and similar function of directing blow-by gas. The failure cause 'Gear train' leading to flow disturbance and resulting in high crankcase pressure is matched. Product similarity (both Gas Engines) and subsystem similarity are sufficient to transfer measures. Although system element varies (Crankcase vs CCV system), the functional linkage and failure cause context justify applying these preventive and detective measures, validating relevance and applicability for the target context."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' related to 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system' with failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' due to 'Crankcase design' is closely related to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The retrieved data focus mostly on the 'CCV (blow-by) system' element directing blow-by gas from crankcase and also on 'Crankcase' element failure cases around design causing flow disturbances and high crankcase pressure. Although the system element names differ slightly (Crankcase vs CCV system) and function wording varies, the core cause 'Crankcase design' and failure mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' with effect of high crankcase pressure align technically in the same product category and subsystem context. Hence, preventive and detective measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' can be transferred and applied. The preventive measures focus on sealing specification, crankcase ventilation system design documentation, and proof of concept testing which directly address crankcase design to prevent flow path disturbance. The detective measures include functional testing of the CCV system and field validation via crankcase and blow-by filter pressure monitoring, which detect disturbances after occurrence. The measures remain relevant and applicable for the target Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase in directing oil-gas mixtures to the CCV system."
CCV (blow-by) system design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, Function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV system', Failure Mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time', Failure Cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design') does not have an exact match in the retrieved data. However, there is a highly relevant similar context available for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, CCV (blow-by) system, Failure Mode 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path over time' caused by 'CCV (blow-by) system design', with the same failure effect 'High pressure in Crankcase'. The system element differs (Crankcase vs CCV system), but function and failure cause are closely related and consistent within the same subsystem and product category. Measures related to CCV (blow-by) system design affecting flow and pressure in crankcase are applicable to the crankcase element directing flow to CCV system in Gas Engine Type 6. Thus, preventive and detective measures from this similar context are transferable and applicable, respecting naming and functional relevance."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and subsystem 'Engine Block' and failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' do not exactly match the retrieved data, which is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' specifically for the 'CCV (blow-by) system' element distributing blow-by gas to filter system. However, the functional context ('Blocking of gas flow path to filter') and failure cause ('Assembly process / Design for assembly') perfectly match, just the system element differs slightly (Crankcase leading oil-gas mixture to CCV vs CCV system distributing blow-by gas). Both belong to the same product category and subsystem with similar function relevance; hence the measures are applicable but with naming variations as per the definition of SIMILAR_CONTEXT. Therefore, preventive and detective measures applicable to assembly and design assembly failures causing blocking of gas flow are transferable and reasonable here."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' and failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)'. The retrieved data shows closely related failure modes 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter' caused by 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' occurring in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' component in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same subsystem. Although system element differs (Crankcase vs CCV system), the functional context is very similar and within the same product category (gas engines), subsystem, and failure cause. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data regarding 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' causing blocking of gas path to filter in the CCV system are applicable and transferable with respect to naming variations. No direct measures for Crankcase blocking gas flow are found but measures addressing the flow path to filter blocking caused by transient engine operation from the closely related CCV system apply as preventive actions to reduce occurrence, and detective measures relate to the same failure mode-cause combination for monitoring and detection."
Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter', and failure cause 'Design for maintenance'. The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' (functionally related and strongly connected to crankcase in the flow path), failure mode 'Blocking of gas flow path to filter', and failure cause 'Design for maintenance'. This is a similar context because system element differs slightly but function and failure mode/cause match. The measures from the CCV system can be transferred and are applicable to the crankcase directing the oil-gas mixture to CCV system, since the crankcase and CCV system operate closely in the blow-by gas flow path within the same subsystem and product category. Hence, preventive and detective measures retrieved for the cause 'Design for maintenance' related to blocking gas flow path to filter in Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable here."
Piping design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, function directing oil-gas mixture to CCV system) is not an exact product match but shares the same subsystem, closely related system elements (Crankcase vs. CCV blow-by system), same failure mode (blocking of gas flow path to filter), same failure cause (piping design), and same failure effect (high pressure in crankcase) with the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4. Measures for failure causes involving piping design for blocking gas flow path to filter in the CCV system of Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable, given the functional and subsystem context similarity and product category match. No contradictory information suggests inapplicability of these measures to the crankcase element for this failure cause. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the Gas Engine Type 4 CCV blow-by system context are transferred and recommended."
Intake system (Gas mixer),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Intake system (Gas mixer)' with the failure mode 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' occurs in the 'Crankcase' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6', while retrieved context data shows the same failure cause and failure mode in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 4', which is the same product category (gas engines) and shared subsystem context. Similar functional purpose and failure relationship justify transferring applicable measures with naming variations."
Power unit,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system (Gas Engine Type 6) shares the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element identity (Crankcase), function (Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV system), failure mode (System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages), and failure cause (Power unit) with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, even though the system element naming differs (Crankcase vs CCV system), all are within the same product category (gas engines) and highly related subsystems. Measures for failure cause 'Power unit' under this failure mode remain applicable and technically consistent."
Turbocharger,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, element Crankcase, function Directs/leads Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV system) and failure mode (System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages) caused by Turbocharger aligns very closely with retrieved data documented for Gas Engine Type 4 in the subsystem Engine Block and system element CCV (blow-by) system, same failure mode and cause. Though the exact system element differs slightly (Crankcase vs. CCV system), they belong to the same product category and subsystem context and share the same failure mode and cause relationship. Therefore, preventive and detective measures for the failure cause 'Turbocharger' from the retrieved context are applicable and technically valid. Measures related specifically to CCV system can be reasonably transferred or adapted since the Crankcase function is directing/leads the mixture to that system."
Design for vibration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase directing oil-gas mixture to CCV with failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment' caused by 'Design for vibration' does not have an exact context match in the retrieved data. However, closely related data exists for 'Gas Engine Type 4' in subsystem 'Engine Block' involving crankcase and CCV (blow-by) system elements with similar failure mode and cause combination 'Oil leakage' or 'Oil leakage to environment' due to 'Design for vibration'. Since these are within the same product category, subsystem, and strongly related system elements (crankcase and CCV interface), preventive and detective measures for 'Design for vibration' failure cause can be transferred and applied, verified to be sensible for crankcase vibration-induced leakage issues."
Piping design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase' function is to direct/lead Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system. The retrieved data includes many exact failure cause and mode matches related to 'Piping design' causing 'Oil leakage to environment' but in the closely related system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block) are the same. Functions are related in directing oil and gas mixtures to/from the crankcase and CCV system, which is highly analogous. Preventive and detective measures from the CCV piping design context are applicable and technically relevant after verification. No direct matches for 'Crankcase' piping design causing oil leakage in Type 6 are found, but the similar context justifies transferring measures on piping design to the crankcase element in Type 6 gas engine due to shared principles of design and leakage mechanisms. Therefore, selected preventive and detective measures from the 'Piping design' failure cause in 'Oil leakage to environment' failure mode for the 'CCV (blow-by) system' in Gas Engine Type 4 are transferred and recommended without modification."
Gasket & O-Ring design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is a Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase in the Engine Block subsystem with the function of directing oil-gas mixture to the CCV (blow-by) system, failure mode is oil leakage to environment, and failure cause is gasket & O-ring design. The retrieved data provide multiple entries from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem mostly focused on CCV (blow-by) system or crankcase components with failure cause 'Gasket & O-Ring design' and failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment' or very close variants (e.g. oil leakage, oil leakage over time). Since the system element naming and function are close (crankcase related sealing and blow-by system), and the failure mode and cause match, this falls under SIMILAR_CONTEXT. The provided preventive and detective measures on gasket and O-ring design in these entries are applicable and relevant to the target context without modification."
O-Ring aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' has the failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment over time' caused by 'O-Ring aging'. The retrieved data with very similar system elements ('Crankcase'), failure mode ('Oil leakage over time'), and failure cause ('O-Ring aging') from 'Gas Engine Type 4' system is used for transfer. Differences exist in system element naming and product version but still within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem, so measures are applicable."
Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system context has the same System Element (Crankcase), Subsystem (Engine Block), Failure Mode (Oil leakage to environment over time), and Failure Cause (Maintenance oil & filter & oil level) as found in Gas Engine Type 4 data. Although the retrieved data mainly addresses the CCV (blow-by) system, due to their functional and subsystem proximity and identical failure cause and mode, preventive and detective measures regarding maintenance applied to the CCV system context are applicable to the Crankcase in Gas Engine Type 6. Measures related specifically to maintenance for oil, filter, and oil level are therefore transferred to the target context, as they remain valid and meaningful."
Bolted joint design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the same Subsystem ('Engine Block'), System Element ('Crankcase'), Function ('Contact to cylinder head assembly'), Failure Mode ('Lack of sealing of fluids between cylinder head and crankcase'), and Failure Cause ('Bolted joint design') as in the retrieved context data for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the exact product variant differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), it is within the same product category and context (gas engines, engine block crankcase bolted joint sealing).

Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with Subsystem 'Engine Block' and System Element 'Crankcase' and failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder during transient engine operation' caused by 'Material selection'. The retrieved context contains multiple exact and similar failure modes and causes for the same failure mode and cause but on a very closely related System Element ('V-room insulation') within the same subsystem ('Engine Block') of a highly similar product ('Gas Engine Type 4').

Retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' which is a similar product in the same product category (gas engines), same subsystem (Engine Block), and same failure mode and cause but different system element ('V-room insulation' vs. 'Crankcase'). The context is similar since both elements direct air/gas/mixture to cylinder heads and share the same failure mode and cause. Measures related to 'Combustion system' failure cause for this failure mode are applicable and meaningful in the target context, including measures for the crankcase design with the same failure mode/cause. Hence preventive and detective measures for 'Combustion system' from retrieved data are transferred and adapted to the crankcase element in this similar context.

Given the similarity of function and failure cause, the preventive and detective measures from the V-room insulation related to crankcase design can be transferred and applied for the Crankcase in the Gas Engine Type 6 subsystem context. No exact match exists but the alignment in product category and functional failure cause supports the use of the retrieved data. Measures related to 'Crankcase design' causing 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture' failure modes are directly relevant and applicable."

Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Design for maintenance' and failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem match exactly, but for a different system element (Crankcase vs. V-room insulation) within the same product category (Gas Engine). The function and failure context are closely related since both guide air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head, so applicable measures from the V-room insulation element are transferred and checked for applicability to the Crankcase element."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' caused by 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'. The retrieved context provides measures primarily for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem 'Engine Block' but related to a similar failure mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder') caused by 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' though mostly on the V-room insulation element. Since Crankcase is a core component related to casting tolerances influencing flow, and the failure cause and mode match, the preventive and detective measures from retrieved data are applicable. Although system element differs slightly ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'), the function and failure cause are the same and product categories are the same (Gas Engines), making it a similar context where measures are transferable and still relevant. Some additional relevant measures from 'Crankcase design' related to flow disturbance and their preventive/detective methods, e.g. design acc. to specification, tolerances, RAIP, FPQ etc. are included for completeness."

Although the system element differs slightly, the system element 'Crankcase' is integral to the gas flow path, and the failure cause and mode are effectively the same, just in similar but not identical components in the same engine block subsystem and product category. The preventive and detective measures for the cause in 'V-room insulation' and related mentions in the crankcase context can be transferred and adapted without contradiction. No new measures beyond retrieved data are created, only transfer and verified applicability."

The retrieved context data matches exactly the combination of system element function, failure mode, and failure cause but comes from a different product model 'Gas Engine Type 4' and for a closely related but differently named component ('V-room insulation') within the same subsystem and product category. Given the functional similarity (directing gas to cylinder head) and identical failure mode and cause, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data are applicable after verifying conceptual validity for 'Crankcase' within the airflow path.

The failure effect 'Surface corrosion on liner landing' is explicitly present in the retrieved data matching the failure effect in the target context. Therefore, no extrapolation or omission of measures is necessary and only measures derived from retrieved data with exact or similar context are used."

O-Ring design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem is Engine Block, and system element is Crankcase, with failure mode 'Coolant leaks into crankcase over time' and failure cause 'O-Ring design'.

The function 'Sealing against leakages coolant' and failure effect match closely. Thus measures from the similar context (same failure cause, failure mode, and product category but different system element and product variant) are applicable and transferred with verification that O-Ring design and sealing functions are fundamentally similar between Crankcase and Cylinder liner assembly in Gas Engines. Preventive measures from retrieved data on O-Ring design for related failure modes in the engine block are: 'O-Ring specification catalogues' and 'O-Ring calculation'.

Retrieved data with Gas Engine Type 4 for the Engine Block subsystem and related sealing failure modes caused by O-Ring aging with coolant leaks or degradation of sealing over time can be applied with same system element and similar function context. Measures applicable to O-Ring aging causing coolant leaks or degradation of sealing over time in crankcase or related sealing elements transferred, as they remain valid and technically correct for the target context.

The exact function name differs slightly ('Sealing against leakages coolant' vs. 'Allow for venting locations for coolant circuit' or '(Ensure that no air is in the coolant circuit)'), which is a related but functionally consistent context. The failure mode and cause are identical. Measures for 'Coolant type and maintenance' causing 'Air in the coolant circuit system' in the crankcase component are available and applicable, including preventive coolant handling and maintenance guidelines and detective measures involving coolant quality measurement and system function testing. Thus, using retrieved measures is valid and applicable here."
Coolant system venting design/strategy,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function of sealing coolant, failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system', failure cause 'Coolant system venting design/strategy') exactly matches the failure mode and cause in the retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, with the same function and failure cause under failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system'. Thus, only the preventive and detective measures retrieved for this exact failure cause and failure mode combination are used."

The measures for crankcase design deficiencies causing insufficient structural support are applicable and technically valid for Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase design deficiencies as well, because the system element identity, subsystem, function, failure mode and failure cause strongly match, albeit in a different engine type of the same product category. Therefore, transfer of measures from the retrieved data is appropriate without creating new measures beyond the retrieved context."
"Bolted joint design errors, including incorrect bolt preload, wrong bolt grade, or inappropriate joint configuration","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, function providing structural support, failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by 'Bolted joint design errors', but the retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, with failure cause 'Bolted joint design' linked to failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in similar components (e.g. Rear end cover which provides structural support). Measures for bolted joint design in structural support failure are applicable across similar engine types and crankcase related structural elements. Hence, these measures are relevant and transferable for the given context."

This closely matches retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and related causes affecting structural support of crankcase or similar components. The preventive and detective measures from this similar context are applicable as they address assembly process related causes impacting structural integrity of crankcase or connected housing. Naming variation and slight differences in product type are acceptable within same product category (gas engine), subsystem, and failure mode/cause combo."
Geometry tolerances not met or incorrect tolerance specifications leading to misfit conditions or stress risers,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element Crankcase, function Provides structural support, failure mode Insufficient structural support, and failure cause Geometry tolerances not met or incorrect tolerance specifications. Retrieved context has measures for the exact failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' under the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in system elements like Front end housing and Rear end cover within the same product category (Gas Engine) and same subsystem (Engine Block) though for Gas Engine Type 4. The failure cause and mode match in essence, so preventive and detective measures from this related context are applicable and transferred here."
Bolted joint design suboptimal for expected vibrational and thermal loads resulting in fatigue or cracking,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with the crankcase element in the engine block subsystem. The failure mode is 'Vibration & thermal transfer induced structural failure' with failure cause 'Bolted joint design suboptimal for expected vibrational and thermal loads resulting in fatigue or cracking'. Retrieved data covers Gas Engine Type 4 with similar subsystem, system element (Crankcase), and failure cause 'Bolted joint design' related to oil leakage/fatigue and vibration-induced issues, all highly relevant and applicable. Measures related to bolted joint design to handle vibrational loads and prevent fatigue/cracking in crankcases are transferable without contradiction or irrelevance, despite a slightly different failure mode focused more on leakage. The underlying cause (bolted joint design under vibration/thermal load) and preventive & detective measures for it remain valid and applicable after verification."
Intake manifold and V-room design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Inconsistent gas density across cylinders', and failure cause 'Intake manifold and V-room design'. Although the exact product 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not available in the retrieved data, there is highly similar context data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with matching subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause (including the intake manifold and V-room design). Both products belong to the same product category (gas engines) and the same subsystem context. Hence, applicable preventive and detective measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for this failure cause can be transferred and are relevant in this new context."
Cylinder head interface design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' but all retrieved data are from 'Gas Engine Type 4' which is a different product version within the same product category (gas engines). The subsystem ('Engine Block'), system element ('Crankcase'), function, failure mode ('Inconsistent gas density across cylinders'), and failure cause ('Cylinder head interface design') match exactly. Therefore, applicable measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' related to this same failure cause and failure mode are transferred due to high relevance and applicability, considering naming consistency and product similarity."
Crankcase design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' performing the function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head' with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and failure cause 'Crankcase design' partially aligns with retrieved context from 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and failure cause 'Crankcase design' in the 'V-room insulation' component. Although the exact component differs ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'), the system element identity relates to the crankcase and its design impacting gas flow. The failure cause 'Crankcase design' is the same and the failure mode same, within the same subsystem and product category (gas engines). Thus, applicable preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data can be transferred and applied to the target context for measures addressing the crankcase design failure cause leading to flow disturbance of gas to cylinder."
V-room design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same Subsystem ('Engine Block'), System Element identity (Crankcase related to V-room design causing flow disturbance of gas to cylinder), Function (gas mixture routing to cylinder), Failure Mode ('Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder'), and Failure Cause ('V-room design'). Although the system element naming varies ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'), the functional and failure context aligns closely within the same product category and subsystem. Measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for the same failure cause and failure mode are applicable by transfer, ensuring technical relevance and consistency with FMEA standards."
Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', and failure cause 'Design for maintenance'. The retrieved context contains very similar failure modes and causes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' for components within the 'Engine Block' subsystem related to gas flow (e.g., V-room insulation) and crankcase design with the same failure cause 'Design for maintenance' leading to flow disturbances and drop in engine performance. Although the system element name differs ('Crankcase' vs. 'V-room insulation'), both address gas mixture routing to cylinder head, and measures for 'Design for maintenance' in this functional context are transferable and applicable to the crankcase element. Preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 regarding 'Design for maintenance' causing flow disturbances have been identified and are technically valid for the Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase context."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' does not exactly match any retrieved entry, as the closest exact match is a different system element 'V-room insulation' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. However, it lies within the same product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), very similar function and identical failure mode and cause—thus a similar context. The measures related to failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)' causing 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and failure effect 'Drop in engine performance' from 'V-room insulation' in Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable for transfer, with a caution that the element name differs but the failure cause and mode are the same and within the same subsystem and product category. Therefore, these preventive and detective measures are applicable for the target context as per the SIMILAR_CONTEXT rule. No other directly matching data applies better."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase in the 'Engine Block' subsystem performing gas mixture routing to cylinder with failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder' and cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' closely matches system elements, failure mode and cause with multiple retrieved data entries from 'Gas Engine Type 4', particularly on 'V-room insulation' component with identical failure mode and cause as well as in 'Crankcase' and 'CCV (blow-by) system' contexts. Since the exact system element 'Crankcase' with this failure mode and cause isn't present but very similar contexts exist (V-room insulation and Crankcase in related failure modes with transient operation cause), these measures are transferable and applicable given they target mitigating transient operation effects on gas flow disturbance. Preventive measures specifically address the failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' and detective measures focus on detection of flow disturbances caused by transient operation. Therefore, measures from flow disturbance failure mode with transient engine operation cause in Gas Engine Type 4 are valid for use here."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Although the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data are for 'Gas Engine Type 4', the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', and failure cause 'Combustion system' align closely in terms of system element and failure context. The retrieved data specifically reference 'V-room insulation' but also include several preventive and detective measures related to 'Crankcase design' and 'Combustion system' for the failure mode 'Flow disturbance of gas to cylinder', which are applicable to the Crankcase in the target system. The product category (gas engines) and subsystem identity are consistent, allowing transfer of these measures while confirming technical relevance."
V-room design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder' and failure cause 'V-room design' corresponds closely in system element function and failure cause with the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' involving the 'V-room insulation' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure modes related to insufficient air/gas/mixture delivery and failure cause 'V-room design'. Although the exact system element name differs (Crankcase vs. V-room insulation), functionally and contextually they are equivalent as V-room is part of the crankcase assembly and controls gas mixture flow. Thus, relevant preventive and detective measures for 'V-room design' cause can be transferred logically to the target system context without introducing new measures beyond retrieved data."
Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', and failure cause 'Material selection'. The retrieved context data shows multiple identical failure causes and modes in a very similar subsystem and element ('V-room insulation' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block' subsystem, same failure mode and cause) within the same product category (Gas Engines). The system element naming difference (Crankcase vs. V-room insulation) is considered functionally close since both relate to the routing of air/gas mixture to the cylinder head within the engine block. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context are transferable and applicable after verification. No exact match context found for 'Crankcase' with the same failure mode and cause, but close enough for valid transfer."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target product is 'Gas Engine Type 6' versus retrieved data 'Gas Engine Type 4' but subsystem (Engine Block), function (Provide/Allows gas mixture route to cylinder head), failure mode (Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder), and failure cause (Casting tolerances (Crankcase)) match. Although system element naming differs ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation' in retrieved data), both relate to gas mixture passage via crankcase design affecting mixture delivery; measures are transferable and applicable."
"Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', and failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' are equivalent or very close to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' specifically for 'V-room insulation' with the same failure mode and cause. Given the same product category (gas engines), subsystem and similar functional roles (gas mixture routing related), the preventive and detective measures for the failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' in the context of insufficient mixture supply are applicable and transferable with adaptation to the crankcase context. No exact match for crankcase element with this failure cause was found, but V-room insulation being part of the engine block air/gas mixture path is functionally similar and the failure cause is identical, qualifying it as similar context."
Combustion system,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, function 'Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head', failure mode 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture to a specific cylinder', failure cause 'Combustion system') differs in product (Type 6 vs Type 4) and system element ('Crankcase' vs 'V-room insulation'). However, the function, failure mode, and failure cause match in context and product category (Gas Engines). The retrieved data mainly associates these failure mode/failure cause combinations with 'V-room insulation' in Gas Engine Type 4. The combustion system failure cause preventive and detective measures are well described and transferable technically because the failure cause relates to mixture delivery and combustion performance. There are no exact matches with Crankcase in Type 6, but the measures relate to combustion failure cause influencing air/gas mixture to cylinders.

Preventive measures explicitly given for the failure cause 'Coolant type and maintenance' in the retrieved data are 'Supplier recommendation', 'Coolant guideline TA xxx', and 'Coolant maintenance plan'. No preventive measures beyond these are provided.

Preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 context are applicable to Gas Engine Type 6 given the similarity in components and function."
Cylinder head interface design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' in the Engine Block subsystem with Crankcase element, sealing function, failure mode of gas mixture leakage and failure cause 'Cylinder head interface design' matches the system element, function, failure mode and cause in the retrieved context but differs in product version (Gas Engine Type 4). Since the product category and system context are similar and measures are applicable, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are transferable here."

O-ring aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture', failure mode 'Gas mixture leakage over time', and failure cause 'O-ring aging'. Retrieved data contains multiple exact matching contexts for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with exactly the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause. This qualifies as a similar context because the product is a different gas engine type but within the same product category (gas engines) and same functional context. Thus, preventive and detective measures for 'O-ring aging' causing 'Gas mixture leakage over time' in the 'Crankcase' are transferable and applicable without modification."
Assembly process deficiencies and lack of design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element with function sealing against leakages of gas mixture and failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' caused by 'Assembly process deficiencies and lack of design for assembly'.

Therefore, the context is similar enough to transfer applicable preventive and detective measures especially relating to assembly process and design for assembly failure causes related to blow-by gas leakage for the crankcase. The provided measures are verified to be applicable to sealing leakage causes and assembly/design deficiencies, and no new measures beyond the retrieved context are introduced. Measures specific to crankcase design and gasket/O-Ring design also apply since crankcase sealing is the focus, corroborating measure relevance."
Crankcase design inadequacies affecting sealing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Although the target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 (different product version), the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakages gas mixture), failure mode (Leakage of blow-by gas over time), and failure cause (Crankcase design inadequacies affecting sealing) closely match multiple failure mode/failure cause contexts from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, element, and function. The measures related to 'Crankcase design' causing leakage of blow-by gas or crankcase leakage (outside) over time in Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable and relevant here due to the same product category, subsystem, element identity, and failure cause nature. Measures from the failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' and 'Leakage crankcase (outside) over time' with failure cause 'Crankcase design' will be transferred for this target context as they address crankcase design inadequacies causing leakage, with no contradictory context found."
CCV (crankcase ventilation) system design flaws,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT as the target system (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase) and failure mode (Leakage of blow-by gas over time) with failure cause (CCV system design flaws) matches the failure cause 'CCV (blow-by) system design' from Gas Engine Type 4 in the same subsystem and system element context; only naming differs slightly. The function of sealing blow-by gas leakage is consistent. Measures from Gas Engine Type 4 CCV system design failure cause are applicable to Gas Engine Type 6 with validation that they still suit the Crankcase sealing function and the failure mode in question."
Piping design faults causing leakage paths,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' caused by 'Piping design faults causing leakage paths' in the 'Crankcase' element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem. Retrieved data provide detailed measures for a highly similar context in 'Gas Engine Type 4', same subsystem ('Engine Block'), related system element ('CCV (blow-by) system'), same failure mode ('Leakage of blow-by gas over time' or 'Leakage of blow-by gas'), and the same failure cause 'Piping design'. Despite slight differences in specific component naming, the function (sealing blow-by gas and managing blow-by gas leakage related to piping design) and failure cause match closely. Preventive and detective measures related to 'Piping design' and 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time' in the collected data are applicable, considering product category and subsystem similarity. Hence, measures transferred from the exact failure cause and mode in the similar product context are valid and meaningful for the target system."
Gasket and O-ring design errors or mismatch,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system Gas Engine Type 6 shares the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Sealing against leakage of gas mixture), and failure mode (Leakage of blow-by gas over time) with available data from Gas Engine Type 4. The failure cause 'Gasket and O-ring design errors or mismatch' matches closely with the failure cause 'Gasket & O-Ring design' found in the Gas Engine Type 4 context, specifically related to blow-by gas leakage or leakage of blow-by gas over time. Although the failure cause names vary slightly, they are semantically equivalent within the scope of sealing failures in the crankcase. Preventive and detective measures for that failure cause exist in the retrieved data and are technically applicable without contradiction to the target system. Therefore, applicable measures are transferred using the corresponding failure cause and failure mode from Gas Engine Type 4 to the Gas Engine Type 6 context."
Corrosion due to humidity exposure in the engine room,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture', failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time', and failure cause 'Corrosion due to humidity exposure in the engine room'. The retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 with 'Engine Block' subsystem and 'Crankcase' element includes the exact failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' with the cause 'Corrosion due to humidity in the engine room' which is strongly contextually matching (only product version differs slightly but product category and subsystem are identical). Preventive and detective measures are thus transferred exactly from the relevant context, no new measures added."
O-ring and sealant/gasket aging and wear,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' has function and failure mode 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture' and failure cause 'O-ring and sealant/gasket aging and wear'. While no exact match data for Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase O-ring and sealant aging is present, multiple highly relevant entries exist for similar contexts in the 'Engine Block' subsystem focusing on 'Crankcase' or closely related components (e.g., Rear end cover, Front end housing) in the same product category (Gas Engines Type 4). The failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' caused by 'O-ring aging' and 'Sealant/Gasket aging' is documented explicitly with corresponding preventive and detective measures that directly address the failure cause. These measures are technically sound and applicable given the similarity of the functional environment, system element, and failure cause. Therefore, these measures are transferred and adapted without modifications for the target system."
Sealant and gasket design inadequacies,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture', failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time', and failure cause 'Sealant and gasket design inadequacies' closely aligns with multiple retrieved cases from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in 'Engine Block' subsystem at various components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover) with failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' and failure cause 'Sealant / Gasket design' or 'Sealant / Gasket aging'. Although exact product and system element names differ slightly (e.g., 'Front end housing' vs 'Crankcase'), the function and failure cause context is strongly similar, and measures apply equally to sealant and gasket design inadequacies. Hence, preventive and detective measures related to 'Sealant / Gasket design' and 'Sealant / Gasket aging' under 'Degradation of sealing over time' are transferred and deemed fully applicable."
Incorrect assembly process or insufficient design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture', failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)', and failure cause 'Incorrect assembly process or insufficient design for assembly' closely matches failure modes and causes found in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem on similar elements (e.g. Rear end cover, Front end housing, Crankcase) regarding blow-by leakage and assembly/design issues. Although exact system element names differ slightly (Crankcase vs Rear end cover or Front end housing), the failure mode and cause context (blow-by leakage related to assembly process and design for assembly) is equivalent and thus measures for 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and related causes are applicable and relevant. This is within the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem context, so measures transferred from the retrieved similar failure cause and mode are valid and technically meaningful."
Bolted joint design errors causing insufficient sealing,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context matches Gas Engine Type (Type 6 vs Type 4) with the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), failure mode (Blow-by leakage or reverse flow), and failure cause (Bolted joint design errors causing insufficient sealing). The retrieved data includes the exact failure mode and failure cause in closely related Gas Engine Types and exactly the same subsystem and system element. Preventive and detective measures are directly transferable and applicable without modification."
Crankcase design faults affecting sealing integrity,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with the crankcase in the engine block subsystem sealing against blow-by leakage caused by crankcase design faults. Relevant retrieved data matches the same system element (crankcase) and failure cause (crankcase design) but from the Gas Engine Type 4 product version and regarding leakage failure modes related to crankcase sealing and blow-by leakage. These failure causes and measures are applicable within the same product category and subsystem context despite the product generation difference, and measures related to crankcase design faults affecting sealing integrity are directly transferable and technically appropriate."
Front/end cover design deficiencies,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is a Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element Crankcase, function Sealing against leakages gas mixture, failure mode Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow), failure cause Front/end cover design deficiencies. Retrieved data covers similar failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' in the Engine Block subsystem and components closely related (front end housing (damper housing), rear end cover), though in Gas Engine Type 4. The failure cause 'Front/End cover design' is present with matching failure mode, allowing transfer of applicable measures after verifying applicability."
Inappropriate geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specification,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved context includes precise matching failure mode 'Blow-by leakage (or reverse flow)' and failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' for the system element 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine' category, closely matching the target 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The documented preventive and detective measures are fully relevant and directly applicable without extrapolation or contextual transfer."
Lubrication system faults contributing to pressure or sealing issues,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function sealing gas mixture to avoid blow-by leakage caused by lubrication system faults. The retrieved data are from Gas Engine Type 4 of the same product category and subsystem (Engine Block), with failures related to lubrication system faults, crankcase design, and sealing issues involving blow-by gas leakage and lubrication insufficiencies. Although the failure mode (blow-by leakage) and failure cause (lubrication system faults) for the Crankcase are not present exactly, similar failure causes and closely related failure modes involving crankcase design, lubrication system faults, and sealing issues (including blow-by gas leakage, leakage over time, lack of sealing, and disturbance/hindrance of flow) are available. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures related to lubrication system faults contributing to sealing and pressure issues in the crankcase can be transferred and adapted, excluding measures irrelevant to sealing or different failure causes. Measures related to lubrication system design, crankcase design, O-ring and gasket specifications, assembly and maintenance processes affecting sealing and pressure control are thus applicable."
Faulty assembly or lack of design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase with failure mode 'Coolant leakage' caused by 'Faulty assembly or lack of design for assembly' is a closely related context to multiple exact failure cause matches in 'Gas Engine Type 4' crankcase and engine block subsystem related to coolant leakage and assembly/design for assembly failure causes. Although exact cause phrasing differs slightly ('Assembly process / Design for assembly'), the failure cause concept is equivalent, within the same product category, subsystem, and system element function. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are transferable and applicable."
Crankcase and front/end cover design issues,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block, system element Crankcase, function sealing against leakages of gas mixture, failure mode coolant leakage, and failure cause crankcase and front/end cover design issues. While exact matches for this exact product and failure cause/failure mode combination are not found, there are multiple highly relevant entries for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase, coolant leakage or leakage-related failure modes caused by crankcase design and front/end cover design with related leakage and sealing failure consequences. The similarity in product category (gas engines), subsystem, system element, and failure cause (design related on crankcase and front/end cover) justifies transferring applicable measures. The preventive and detective measures related specifically to crankcase design and front/end cover design addressing coolant leakage and sealing issues from Gas Engine Type 4 context are applicable and make technical sense for the Gas Engine Type 6 target system."
Assembly defects and inadequate design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Sealing against leakages gas mixture', failure mode 'Oil leakage', and failure cause 'Assembly defects and inadequate design for assembly'. The retrieved data contains extensive relevant data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem, primarily concerning 'Oil leakage' or similar leakage modes (such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time') related to the crankcase and sealing functions. The failure cause 'Assembly defects and inadequate design for assembly' corresponds closely with retrieved failure causes 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)'. These retrieved failure causes, preventive and detective measures are technically applicable to the target context, given identical subsystem, similar system element identity (crankcase and associated sealing areas), and leakage failure mode. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures are transferred from these entries without modifications beyond naming alignment."
Crankcase design shortcomings and gasket/O-ring aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) with the subsystem (Engine Block) and system element (Crankcase) matches closely with the retrieved context from Gas Engine Type 4 systems for the same subsystem and system element. The function (Sealing against leakages of gas mixture) relates directly to sealing and leakage failure modes involving oil leakage. The failure mode 'Oil leakage' and failure cause 'Crankcase design shortcomings and gasket/O-ring aging' correspond well to failure causes in the retrieved data such as 'Crankcase design' and 'O-Ring aging' causing oil leakage in crankcase within the same product category and subsystem context. Naming variations and minor differences in failure cause phrasing are aligned. Therefore, transferred measures for these failure causes apply logically and technically to the target context."
"Crankcase structural design deviations, improper assembly tolerances, geometry tolerance stack-up errors","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Although the exact failure mode 'Misalignment of PCJ and crankcase' is not retrieved, closely related failure causes involving 'Crankcase design', 'Geometry tolerances', and 'Assembly/tolerance stack-up issues' with closely related failure modes such as 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Insufficient clearance' in the engine block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4 are available. The system element (crankcase), subsystem (engine block), and product category (gas engine) are consistent where measures for crankcase design deviations and tolerance stack-up issues apply. The retrieved preventive and detective measures for these failure causes are applicable to reduce or detect the listed causes of misalignment in the target Gas Engine Type 6 context, specifically for structural design deviations, assembly tolerances, and geometry tolerance stack-ups. Preventive measures addressing design to specification, tolerance specification, modeling/simulation (MBS, FEA) and involving production teams apply. Detective measures such as assembly tests, endurance runs, and testbench performance evaluations are also appropriate. Therefore, these measures are relevant and technically sound for the given failure cause despite not being an exact failure mode match."
"Aging, hardening or degradation of O-ring or sealing elements; improper sealing design or material selection; thermal cycling and vibration induced seal wear","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 (different from Gas Engine Type 4 in the retrieved data) but within the same product category (Gas Engines), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Contact / Fit to PCJ is closely related to sealing function at crankcase interface), failure mode (oil leakage through crankcase-PCJ interface over time) and failure causes (aging, hardening or degradation of O-ring or sealing elements; improper sealing design or material selection; thermal cycling and vibration induced seal wear) match or are analogous to retrieved failure causes of 'Degradation of sealing over time' and 'Oil leakage over time' at the crankcase or similar interface components. Measures are transferred with naming variations considered and verified as applicable to the new target system context."
Design for assembly deficiencies; difficult tolerance specifications; inadequate consideration of maintenance and replacement access; sensor placement conflicts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure context 'Poor serviceability of crankcase-PCJ interface due to design for assembly deficiencies, difficult tolerance specs, inadequate maintenance and replacement access, sensor placement conflicts' in the 'Crankcase' system element of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not exactly matched by retrieved data. However, there are multiple similar failure modes ('Poor serviceability') and causes related to 'Assembly process / Design for assembly,' 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,' 'Design for maintenance,' and 'Sensor specifications' for 'Poor serviceability' in various engine block components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover) within the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. The subsystem and system element function (interface/serviceability issues) and failure causes (design for assembly, tolerance issues, maintenability, sensor placement) are closely aligned. These measures can be transferred and adapted, considering similar product category, subsystem, and functional challenges. Preventive measures address failure causes only; detective measures address failure mode-cause combinations as per FMEA rules."
Inadequate bolted joint design; insufficient crankcase wall thickness; incorrect geometry tolerances; poor design of front/end cover or mating structures,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support for PCJ interface' and failure causes of bolted joint design, crankcase wall thickness, and geometry tolerances is very similar to the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' subsystem 'Engine Block', specifically failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and related failure causes (bolted joint design, crankcase design, geometry tolerances). Though the PCJ interface is a more specific area than the 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', the structural support failure mode and causes align closely in functionality and component relations in the same product category and subsystem. Preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data for the matching failure causes are applicable with naming variations accepted. No new measures beyond retrieved data are included."
Assembly process errors causing imbalance; bolted joint preload errors; crankcase design flaws; transient engine operations like start-up and cooldown inducing resonance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure cause and failure mode relate to vibration at the crankcase-PCJ interface in a Gas Engine engine block subsystem (Crankcase), while the retrieved data covers very similar failure causes (assembly process errors, bolted joint design flaws, crankcase design flaws, transient engine operation causing vibration) and failure mode 'Vibration is too high' or related vibration issues in the crankcase and engine block of Gas Engine Type 4, which is a similar product category and subsystem context but different product version (Type 6 vs Type 4). Measures are transferable as they are relevant to vibration induced fatigue and bolted joint issues in the engine block crankcase region, thus applicable to the target context."
Inadequate design for vibration damping; improper assembly; crankcase or CCV system design flaws; lack of maintenance of oil or filter condition affecting system damping,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with the Engine Block subsystem and Crankcase element. The failure mode 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification limits' and failure causes (inadequate design for vibration damping; improper assembly; crankcase or CCV system design flaws; lack of maintenance of oil or filter condition affecting system damping) closely match failure modes and causes documented for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, and CCV (blow-by) system with the same vibration-related failure mode and causes. Although System Element differs slightly (Crankcase vs CCV system component), both relate closely within the engine block regarding vibration effects and sensor installation. The preventive and detective measures from the CCV system vibration failure context are applicable and technically relevant to the Crankcase vibration failure cause context in Gas Engine Type 6 and therefore transferable with validation."
Surface finish defects; corrosion or contamination; thermal expansion mismatch; improper machining or assembly process errors,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Sticking or binding at interface fit dimensions' due to 'Surface finish defects; corrosion or contamination; thermal expansion mismatch; improper machining or assembly process errors' on the 'Crankcase' for the function 'Contact / Fit to PCJ' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact or similar matches in the retrieved context data. The available data relates mostly to other failure modes such as leakage, structural support, vibration, blow-by leakage, contact to piston, poor serviceability, liner contact disruption, degradation of sealing, etc., none of which directly correspond to the specific failure mode and causes of sticking/binding at an interface fit in crankcase related to PCJ articulation in Gas Engine Type 6. Although the product category and subsystem are similar (gas engine, engine block), the specific failure mode and causes with function 'Contact / Fit to PCJ' are not found in the retrieved dataset. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or inferred without introducing new, unsupported measures."
Crankcase structural design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' having failure cause 'Crankcase structural design' leading to 'Poor serviceability' of providing installation space for sensors. Retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem and system element with matching function, failure mode, and failure cause, only product version differs within the same product category (gas engines). Therefore, all retrieved preventive and detective measures from this close similar context are applicable for transfer and use in the target system context."
Sensor specification mismatch,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Sensor specification mismatch' in 'Crankcase' for 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' has no exact match or any similar failure cause-context combination in the retrieved data. The retrieved data has 'Sensor specifications' failure cause related to 'Poor serviceability' only for Gas Engine Type 4 and not specifically linked with 'Sensor specification mismatch' on 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem for Gas Engine Type 6, plus the product type differs (Type 6 vs. Type 4). Hence no measures can be transferred with confidence following the defined decision matrix."
Assembly process / Design for assembly deficiencies,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase' and failure mode 'Poor serviceability' with failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly deficiencies' do not have an exact match in the retrieved data, but there is a highly similar context for 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' cause with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' and subsystem 'Engine Block', although in a different system element ('CCV (blow-by) system'). Given same product category (Gas Engine), same subsystem, same failure mode and cause, preventive and detective measures transferred are applicable and relevant after terminology adjustment."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification in crankcase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Crankcase' as in retrieved Gas Engine Type 4 data, with the same failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'. Although the failure mode differs ('Poor serviceability' vs. 'Insufficient clearance'), the failure cause and system element context are sufficiently comparable to transfer and adapt appropriate preventive and detective measures. The failure mode and failure effect differ but the underlying causes and subsystem context are within the same product category and functional area, so measures related to geometry tolerances and crankcase design are applicable."
Crankcase structural design not adequately dampening vibrations,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 crankcase in Engine Block subsystem providing installation space for sensors with the failure mode 'Vibration is too high' caused by 'Crankcase structural design not adequately dampening vibrations'. The retrieved context contains data on 'Vibration is too high' failure mode caused by 'Crankcase design' in similar Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase element context, with matching failure mode and cause concept (though wording slightly different). Hence, applicable preventive and detective measures are transferred appropriately and technically valid for the target."
Bolted joint design insufficient to prevent loosening,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Bolted joint design insufficient to prevent loosening' causing 'Vibration is too high' on the 'Crankcase' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact match in retrieved context. The retrieved data references similar failure causes ('Bolted joint design') with the same failure mode 'Vibration is too high' but always in different system elements (e.g. 'Front end housing (damper housing)') or different failure modes (mostly 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time') in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Despite the same product category and subsystem, no measures are found for 'Bolted joint design' causing 'Vibration is too high' on 'Crankcase' providing installation space for sensors specifically in Gas Engine Type 6. Therefore, per decision matrix, no measures can be transferred or generated from the available data."
"Transient engine operation conditions (start up, cool down) causing excessive vibration","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, function: provides installation space for sensors, failure mode: vibration too high, failure cause: transient engine operation) has no exact match in retrieved data. However, there is a strong similarity with failure mode 'Vibration is too high' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component and similar causes including 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' in Gas Engine Type 4 within the same subsystem (Engine Block). Both contexts share the same failure mode, failure cause, and subsystem with the core focus on vibration issues affecting installation or interfaces of sensors or mechanical parts. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from this similar context are transferred as applicable and technically valid for the crankcase element in Gas Engine Type 6."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data directly related to the target failure mode 'Incorrect installation position of sensors' caused by 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' for the system element 'Crankcase' providing 'installation space for sensors' in Gas Engine Type 6. The closest matches in data are from Gas Engine Type 4 but refer to failure modes like 'Blow-by leakage', 'Vibration is too high', or 'Poor serviceability', none exactly matching the failure mode and cause combination in the target. Thus, no exact or sufficiently similar context is found to safely transfer measures."
Crankcase structural design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' is different from the retrieved data system 'Gas Engine Type 4', but the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', function 'Provides installation space for cable routing', failure mode 'Poor serviceability', and failure cause 'Crankcase structural design' match exactly. The product category is the same (gas engines) and the context is directly analogous, so transferred preventive and detective measures are applicable."
Sensor specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target context differs only in product version (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Type 4) but matches subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function (Provides installation space for cable routing), failure mode (Poor serviceability), and failure cause (Sensor specification). Thus, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 for the exact same function and failure cause are applicable and technically consistent for Type 6."
Crankcase structural design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element Crankcase, function 'Provides installation space for cable routing', failure mode 'Lack of structure for support', and failure cause 'Crankcase structural design'. Retrieved data shows similar failure mode and cause for Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block, Crankcase with same function and failure cause. Given the close product family and matching technical context, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable and transferred here."
Sensor specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context 'Gas Engine Type 6', 'Engine Block', 'Crankcase', 'Provides installation space for cable routing', failure mode 'Lack of structure for support', failure cause 'Sensor specification' closely matches multiple entries from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause. Although the product variant differs (Type 4 vs Type 6), both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and share similar subsystem and element context. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data for Type 4 context are transferable and applicable."
Crankcase structural design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' crankcase providing installation space for cable routing with failure mode 'Cable breakage to initial support' caused by 'Crankcase structural design' matches the retrieved context in product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), function and failure cause exactly but product differs (Type 6 vs Type 4). Since this is a strong similarity within the same product category and similar subsystem/function context, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 crankcase for the same failure cause and mode are applicable and transferred without creating new ones."
Sensor specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block, Crankcase, providing installation space for cable routing, failure mode: cable breakage to initial support, failure cause: sensor specification) matches exactly the System Element, Function, Failure Mode and Failure Cause of retrieved data but differs in product variant (Gas Engine Type 4 vs Type 6). Both are within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem context (Engine Block). Measures from Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable after verifying they address sensor specification related causes for cable breakage. The retrieved preventive measures 'Supplier recommendation', 'CAD Model check with service', 'Vibration design values' and the detective measure 'Assembly test' directly address the failure cause 'Sensor specification' for cable breakage at installation support in the crankcase, thus are applicable and transferred. No additional measures outside the retrieved data are generated."
Design flaws in front housing geometry leading to insufficient stiffness or load-bearing capacity,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 with Engine Block subsystem and End cover / Front housing element, having failure mode 'Loss of structural support' caused by 'Design flaws in front housing geometry leading to insufficient stiffness or load-bearing capacity'. The retrieved data shows directly relevant failure mode and cause in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component of Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem, with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' caused by design-related issues (e.g. 'Front/End cover design' and 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification'). Although the engine type is different, the system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause are highly similar (front housing stiffness/design flaws). Measures addressing design flaws or geometry/tolerances in front/end housing design in Type 4 engines are applicable and technically correct to transfer to Type 6 engine context. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures from this context have been extracted without introducing any new concepts beyond the retrieved context."
Improper bolted joint design or incorrect assembly torque causing joint loosening,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Improper bolted joint design or incorrect assembly torque causing joint loosening' causing 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' system is closely related to failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)' causing 'Insufficient structural support' or 'Degradation of sealing over time' in similar engine block contexts for Gas Engine Type 4. Though there is no exact match for the exact system element 'End cover / Front housing' and exact failure cause phrasing, the bolted joint design and assembly process failure causes in bolted joints from the same product category and subsystem are applicable. Measures for bolted joint design and assembly process bolted joint design are transferable and relevant for preventing and detecting improper bolted joint design or incorrect assembly torque causing loosening."
"Crack initiation from fatigue due to vibration and transient engine operation (start-up, cool-down thermal stresses)","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Structural support fails' caused by 'Crack initiation from fatigue due to vibration and transient engine operation'. The retrieved data contains highly relevant and similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 in the Engine Block subsystem, specifically about structural support failure of front or end covers (Front end housing/damper housing) with causes including vibration and transient engine operation. The failure causes 'Design for vibration' and 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' align closely with the target failure cause of crack initiation from fatigue due to vibration and transient stresses. Though exact match on engine type and detailed function is not found, the system element and failure cause context is similar and preventive and detective measures related to vibration, design, FEA, transient operation, and testing are applicable and transferable. Measures related to assembly, design processes, FEA, vibration testing, endurance runs, and condition monitoring align well with reducing and detecting the occurrence of fatigue cracks from vibration and transient stresses in the front end cover/front housing."
Incorrect tolerance stack-up or manufacturing deviations affecting part fit and surface contact,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Functional limitation - Reduced support stiffness' caused by 'Incorrect tolerance stack-up or manufacturing deviations affecting part fit and surface contact' on the 'End cover / Front housing' in 'Gas Engine Type 6', but the retrieved data contains no exact or sufficiently close match for this failure mode and cause. The closest related failure modes in retrieved data are 'Vibration is too high' and 'Insufficient structural support' on 'Front end housing (damper housing)' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', which relate to vibration or insufficient support but not specifically reduced support stiffness due to tolerance stack-up/manufacturing deviations on End cover / Front housing. Hence, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be confidently transferred without risking technical inaccuracy."
Corrosion or material degradation due to poor surface treatment or environmental exposure,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no exact match or sufficiently similar failure cause related to 'Corrosion or material degradation due to poor surface treatment or environmental exposure' on 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'; retrieved data mainly covers other failure causes (sealing degradation, oil contamination, bolted joint design, etc.) and different failure modes, failure causes, or system elements mainly from Gas Engine Type 4. No applicable preventive or detective measures can be directly transferred or adapted without introducing new measures beyond retrieved context."
Overly stiff design not accounting for thermal expansion mismatch causing stress concentrations,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Overfunction (excessive rigidity)' caused by an 'Overly stiff design not accounting for thermal expansion mismatch causing stress concentrations' in 'End cover / Front housing' of the 'Gas Engine Type 6', whereas the retrieved data contains failure causes and measures majorly for 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient clearance', 'Degradation of sealing', or 'Oil/Mixture leakage' in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. No retrieved data specifically matches or is similar in failure mode or failure cause context related to 'Overfunction' or excessive rigidity causing thermal expansion mismatch stress in 'End cover / Front housing'. Hence, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be derived from the retrieved data."
Insufficient design consideration for cable and sensor installation space in front housing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Unintended function – Misalignment of cable routing' caused by 'Insufficient design consideration for cable and sensor installation space in front housing'. The retrieved data contains measures for very similar failure modes related to cable and sensor installation space issues (e.g., 'Poor serviceability', 'Lack of structure for support', 'Insufficient structural support') specifically in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' which is analogous to the target 'End cover / Front housing' component of the engine block subsystem in a different Gas Engine type (Type 4). These failure causes and functions share high conceptual alignment (mechanical support and installation space affecting cable/sensor routing). Hence, preventive and detective measures from these corresponding failure causes and failure modes can be transferred and applied here with relevance and technical correctness."
Plastic deformation caused by overload or impact leading to permanent set in housing structure,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to lack of retrieved context data directly matching the failure cause 'Plastic deformation caused by overload or impact leading to permanent set in housing structure' for the system element 'End cover / Front housing' with failure mode 'Sticking at a certain deformation value' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem. Existing retrieved data refer mainly to failure modes related to leakage, insufficient structural support, sealing degradation, and vibration in Gas Engine Type 4, but none address plastic deformation or overload/impact deformation causing sticking or permanent set in front housing structures. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated based on the provided data."
Design or assembly errors causing load paths to transfer stresses improperly through housing,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: There is no exact or similar failure cause related to 'Incorrect direction of load transfer' due to 'Design or assembly errors causing load paths to transfer stresses improperly through housing' identified for the 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data mainly relates to failure modes and causes such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Incorrect positioning of sensors', 'Vibration is too high', and 'Poor serviceability' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', but none match the failure cause for the requested failure mode in the target system. Therefore, based on the context analysis decision matrix, no preventive or detective measures can be generated."
Design not accounting for ease of maintenance and accessibility of front housing fasteners and seals,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'End cover / Front housing' providing mechanical support and structural integrity to the front section of the engine block. The failure mode is 'Poor serviceability' caused by design not accounting for ease of maintenance and accessibility of front housing fasteners and seals. Retrieved data shows highly similar context for 'Front/End cover design' as a failure cause for 'Poor serviceability' in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within 'Engine Block' subsystem and similar system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)'. The function differs slightly but shares analogous concerns about assembly, maintenance, and accessibility. Measures for 'Front/End cover design' in this context are appropriate to transfer and adapt, as preventive measures directly address design involvement, specification adherence, tolerances, simulations, service team input, and sealing design. Detective measures correspond to testbench and assembly tests relevant to detect design related problems affecting serviceability through inspection and performance monitoring. Thus, SIMILAR_CONTEXT applies with relevant and applicable measures transferable without introducing non-existent measures or unrelated contexts."
Incorrect geometry or surface finish on sealing surfaces of front housing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Incorrect geometry or surface finish on sealing surfaces of front housing' corresponds closely to failure causes 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' and 'Part is not machined to spec' related to sealing interface integrity in engine block components (e.g., end cover and liner interfaces) from the Gas Engine Type 4 subsystem. Although the subsystem and exact component differ slightly (front housing vs rear end cover or liner interface), the system element identity (end cover / front housing), function (mechanical support and sealing), failure mode (loss of sealing interface integrity), and failure cause (geometry/surface finish issues) are highly comparable and contextually relevant within the same product category (Gas Engine). Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures from similar failure causes in retrieved data are transferable and valid here."
O-Ring aging and material degradation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is a Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, End cover / Front housing component, with a failure mode of loss of sealing function causing coolant leakage due to O-Ring aging and material degradation. Retrieved data is from a very similar system context (Gas Engine Type 4) on Engine Block subsystem components (front end housing, rear end cover, crankcase, cylinder liner assembly) with failure modes related to sealing degradation or coolant leakage and failure cause 'O-Ring aging'. Although subsystem element is not exactly the same (End cover / Front housing vs Front end housing or others), system element function (seal front end to prevent oil/coolant leakage) and failure cause (O-Ring aging) match well to transfer preventive and detective measures under SIMILAR_CONTEXT rules. Measures retrieved are directly applicable and technically correct for the target context."
Bolted joint loosening due to vibration and improper preload,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Bolted joint loosening due to vibration and improper preload' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' closely corresponds to failure causes related to bolted joint loosening or bolt loosening from vibration in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with similar subsystem and failure mode context (loss of sealing leading to oil leakage). The failure cause and failure mode are analogous, even if exact naming and engine model differ. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context on 'Bolt loosening from vibration', 'Bolted joint design', and 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)' are relevant and applicable while addressing the joint loosening due to vibration and preload issues. Measures are adapted by naming convention equivalence but not invented beyond retrieved data."
Sealant/gasket aging and improper material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 but the retrieved data is for Gas Engine Type 4, and the subsystem (Engine Block), system element function (Seal the front end of the engine block), failure mode (Degradation of sealing over time / sealant or gasket degradation resulting in incomplete sealing), and failure cause (Sealant/gasket aging and improper material selection) closely match. The context difference is minor, and the measures from Gas Engine Type 4 for sealing degradation of front/end covers are applicable for Gas Engine Type 6 front housing (end cover)."
Thermal expansion mismatch between end cover and engine block materials causing seal slippage or transient gaps,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Thermal expansion mismatch between end cover and engine block materials causing seal slippage or transient gaps' related to 'End cover / Front housing' sealing integrity during thermal cycling in Gas Engine Type 6 has no corresponding exact or similar failure cause with this thermal expansion mismatch in the retrieved data. The retrieved data mostly relates to design, assembly, bolted joint, gasket aging, O-ring aging, and vibration issues but not thermal expansion mismatch causing seal slippage or transient gaps. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or derived from the available context data."
Assembly process errors including improper bolt torque or alignment deviation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Incorrect assembly leading to misalignment or damage of sealing surfaces' caused by 'Assembly process errors including improper bolt torque or alignment deviation' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of a Gas Engine Type 6, while the retrieved data covers different failure modes such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Oil leakage over time', 'Incorrect positioning of locking pin', and 'Degradation of sealing over time' with failure causes primarily related to design, material, bolted joint design, or other assembly aspects but not explicitly addressing assembly errors causing misalignment or damage of sealing surfaces on the front housing. Also, the target is Gas Engine Type 6 and the retrieved data is only for Gas Engine Type 4. No measures explicitly covering improper bolt torque or alignment deviation in assembly for the front housing end cover are found. Thus, no exact or similar context measures apply."
Excessive internal crankcase or coolant pressure due to system faults or blockage,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Excessive internal crankcase or coolant pressure due to system faults or blockage' causing 'Overpressure causing seal extrusion or rupture' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' relates closely to failure causes and modes involving 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages' and 'System pressure exceeding limits leading to leakages over time' in the 'CCV (blow-by) system' and crankcase of 'Gas Engine Type 4', same product category and subsystem context but different product and slightly different system element. Measures related to controlling crankcase and coolant pressure excess, blockage and transient engine operation effects are applicable and transferable here."
Humidity and corrosive environment in engine room affecting metal and sealing components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element End cover / Front housing, with failure mode 'Corrosion-induced degradation of sealing surfaces' caused by 'Humidity and corrosive environment in engine room'. The retrieved data includes several failure modes related to sealing degradation, corrosion due to humidity in the engine room, and degradation of sealing surfaces in similar components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover) within the same product category (Gas Engine) and subsystem (Engine Block) though mainly from Gas Engine Type 4. The failure cause and mode combination is not an exact match, but very similar context with same subsystem, similar elements, and same cause of humidity corrosion affecting sealing surfaces. Hence preventive and detective measures from 'Corrosion due to humidity in engine room' and 'Degradation of sealing over time' with corrosion cause and sealing degradation failure modes are applicable and technically fit the target context."
"Design or manufacturing tolerances outside specification, stress concentration","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Design or manufacturing tolerances outside specification, stress concentration' leading to 'Material plasticity or deformation of end cover affecting sealing geometry' in 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' and sealing function has no exact or sufficiently similar context data in the retrieved dataset. Existing data relates to different failure modes (e.g., vibration, blow-by leakage, insufficient lubrication, degradation of sealing) mostly in Gas Engine Type 4 and different failure causes or system elements."
"Contamination, corrosion deposits, or maintenance neglect","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'End cover / Front housing' involves sealing to prevent oil and coolant leakage, specifically concerning failure mode 'Sticking or blockage of drain or ventilation ports' due to 'Contamination, corrosion deposits, or maintenance neglect'. Although there is no exact match for this failure cause and failure mode combination in retrieved data, very similar failure modes related to 'Oil contamination', 'Coolant leakage', and 'Degradation of sealing over time' in front/rear end housing or front end housing components in 'Gas Engine Type 4' are found. These share the product category (gas engine), system element identity (front housing/end cover), subsystem (engine block), and involve contamination, corrosion, maintenance neglect as causes for sealing or fluid flow failures. Thus, preventive and detective measures from these similar contexts are applicable and reasonable without modification for the target context."
Assembly process / Design for assembly - insufficient consideration of production and service requirements leading to difficult mounting and dismounting of timing gears and belts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly - insufficient consideration of production and service requirements leading to difficult mounting and dismounting of timing gears and belts' under the failure mode 'Poor serviceability' for the 'End cover / Front housing' system element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' does not have an exact match in the retrieved data. However, similar failure causes 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' causing 'Poor serviceability' are documented several times in 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem, particularly on front end housing, CCV system, and rear end cover components. These contexts match on the system element identity level (front end housing ~ front housing), subsystem, failure mode, and failure cause concept, just with different product type and slightly different system element naming. As these are from the same product category (gas engines) and same subsystem with comparable assembly and service functions, the preventive and detective measures for assembly process / design for assembly causing poor serviceability are applicable and relevant, with adaptation for naming difference. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures from the 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' cause for 'Poor serviceability' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'CCV (blow-by) system' are transferred and recommended for the target system element without introducing any new measures beyond retrieved data."
Front cover design does not provide adequate stiffness or reinforcement to support mounted timing gears and belts under operational loads and vibrations,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Lack of structural support' and failure cause 'Front cover design does not provide adequate stiffness or reinforcement' match closely with failure cause 'Front/End cover design' causing failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' or similar 'Insufficient structural support' in front/end cover components in Gas Engine Type 4 (a similar product category and subsystem). Despite slightly different naming ('Front cover design' vs 'Front/End cover design'), the context, subsystem, and failure mode are closely aligned within the engine block subsystem of gas engines. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from this similar context are applicable and transferred while ensuring relevance to mounting interface and structural stiffness requirements."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification or design inaccuracies in front housing leading to misalignment of mounting surfaces for timing gears and belts,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification or design inaccuracies in front housing leading to misalignment of mounting surfaces for timing gears and belts' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches the failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' in similar front or rear end cover housing components in 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same product category and subsystem context with similar failure modes related to incorrect positioning. Measures retrieved from those contexts are applicable and technically relevant, considering tolerance stackup and design specification control are common and valid preventive actions against tolerance-related positioning issues. Therefore, the closest matching context data related to 'Incorrect positioning' failure modes and 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' cause in the front/rear end cover or housing components are used."
"Bolted joint design flaws, improper gasket or O-ring specifications, or assembly misalignment causing oil or coolant leakage","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Bolted joint design flaws, improper gasket or O-ring specifications, or assembly misalignment causing oil or coolant leakage' matches failure causes 'Bolted joint design', 'O-Ring design', and 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)' causing oil or coolant leakage in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4 which is a highly similar system to Gas Engine Type 6. The system elements vary in naming (front housing = Front end housing, end cover similar to front/rear end cover), but the sealing function and failure mode (oil or coolant leakage at housing interfaces) and failure causes are equivalent. Measures from the Type 4, Engine Block context for sealing failure due to bolted joint design, O-ring design, and assembly process are applicable and relevant without creating new measures."
"Material selection/design not accounting for thermal expansion or vibration loading, insufficient FEA validation during design","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element End cover / Front housing, and the retrieved data has similar system element concepts (Front end housing / Front/End cover design) with failure modes related to structural and vibration issues in Gas Engine Type 4. The failure cause of design issues related to load and FEA validation is comparable to 'Front/End cover design' failure cause addressing design adequacy and FEA. The preventive and detective measures from that context are applicable and technically relevant to address material/design and FEA validation issues leading to structural deformation under load."
"Design overlaps or interference with adjacent front-end components (e.g., sensors, pulleys) causing excessive forces or constraints on timing gears and belts","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Design overlaps or interference with adjacent front-end components' causing 'Overfunction due to unintended mounting feature interaction' in the 'End cover / Front housing' system element and function relates specifically to mechanical interference and excessive forces on timing gears and belts. This failure cause and failure mode combination is not present in the retrieved data, which mainly focuses on vibration-related issues, assembly, bolted joint and design adequacy causes in front/rear end housings, sensor positioning, lubrication, oil leakage, and serviceability for Gas Engine Type 4 and similar subsystems. No direct or similar failure cause related to design overlaps or physical interference with mounting features has been found. Hence, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or provided based on the retrieved context."
Inadequate surface treatment or protective coatings on the front cover leading to corrosion in harsh environments,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure cause relates specifically to 'Inadequate surface treatment or protective coatings on the front cover leading to corrosion in harsh environments' causing 'Corrosion or surface degradation of mounting interfaces' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of a 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context contains extensive data related to similar engine block elements and failure modes such as 'Poor serviceability', 'Oil contamination', 'Coolant leakage', 'Degradation of sealing', and some cover/front housing design causes mostly concerning design, assembly, tolerances, paint per RAIP 43200 or corrosion due to humidity primarily in Gas Engine Type 4. However, none explicitly address corrosion or surface degradation caused by inadequate surface treatment or protective coatings on front cover mounting interfaces or provide direct preventive/detective measures tailored for corrosion protection and detection in this exact match of failure cause and failure mode. The similarity is insufficient to confidently transfer preventive or detective measures targeting coating or surface treatment inadequacies related to corrosion of mounting interfaces. Hence, no applicable measures can be generated from the provided data for this specific failure cause."
Manufacturing defects or tolerances causing warped or deformed front housing surfaces restricting proper mounting of timing components,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved data that exactly or similarly matches the target failure cause 'Manufacturing defects or tolerances causing warped or deformed front housing surfaces restricting proper mounting of timing components' for the system element 'End cover / Front housing' in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. All retrieved data relates to 'Gas Engine Type 4' and different failure modes such as 'Incorrect positioning of sensors', 'Poor serviceability', 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient clearence', 'Blow-by leakage', etc., mostly related to other system elements or different failure causes in a similar product category but not matching the exact failure cause. Hence, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or reused without risk of technical inaccuracy."
Bolted joint design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the Target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and retrieved data 'Gas Engine Type 4' share the same Product Category (Gas Engines), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element function (Sealing of housing covers), Failure Mode (Degradation of sealing over time), and Failure Cause (Bolted joint design) with minor naming variations (End cover / Front Housing vs Front end housing (damper housing)). Preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 context are applicable and technically valid for Gas Engine Type 6."
Corrosion due to humidity in the engine room,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'End cover / Front housing'. The retrieved context has data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)', which is functionally equivalent to 'End cover / Front housing' as similar core functional components accommodating and supporting sealing elements. The failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' and failure cause 'Corrosion due to humidity in the engine room' exactly match. Thus, preventive and detective measures for the same failure cause and mode from the similar system element in a different but similar system (Gas Engine Type 4) are applicable and technically valid to transfer here."
O-Ring aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with system element 'End cover / Front housing' and failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' due to 'O-Ring aging' is very similar to the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block', 'Front end housing (damper housing)', and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' components with the same failure mode and cause. The functions are comparable (accommodate/support sealing elements and sealing crankcase/crankshaft). Measures for this failure cause are consistent across these elements in the same product category and subsystem, so the preventive and detective measures can be transferred and applied here."
Sealant / Gasket aging,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and context (Engine Block subsystem with End cover / Front housing element, function to accommodate gaskets and O-rings, failure mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' caused by 'Sealant / Gasket aging') closely matches the retrieved data for Gas Engine Type 4 in the Engine Block subsystem with front or rear housing sealing the crankcase. Although the exact system element name differs slightly ('End cover / Front housing' vs 'Front end housing (damper housing)'), both fulfill the similar sealing function and share the same failure cause and mode, allowing transfer of measures. Preventive and detective measures are applicable after verifying relevance, as sealing principles and failure mechanisms remain consistent within the product category and subsystem. No new measures beyond retrieved data are introduced."
Sealant / Gasket design,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element End Cover / Front Housing, functionally similar to 'Front end housing (damper housing)' in Gas Engine Type 4 and with exact matching Failure Mode 'Degradation of sealing over time' and Failure Cause 'Sealant / Gasket design'. Although the products differ in engine type number, context and function match sufficiently to transfer measures from Gas Engine Type 4 to Gas Engine Type 6."
Wrong maintenance activity plan,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element End cover / Front housing, function is to accommodate and support sealing elements. The failure mode 'Loss of sealing function due to improper maintenance' caused by 'Wrong maintenance activity plan' is similar in nature to 'Degradation of sealing over time' failure mode caused by 'Wrong maintenance activity plan' in Front end housing (damper housing) and Rear end cover (flywheel side) of Gas Engine Type 4 Engine Block subsystem. Although exact match of failure mode is not found, these cases involve sealing elements, engine block end cover or housing components with failure cause as wrong maintenance activity plan affecting sealing. Measures related to wrong maintenance activity plan in the context of sealing and engine block end covers/housing from Gas Engine Type 4 are technically applicable and transferable due to system similarity."
Assembly process / Design for assembly issues,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly issues' and failure mode 'Functional interruption due to assembly defects' for the system element 'End cover / Front housing' (which is similar to 'Front end housing (damper housing)') in the subsystem 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to similar failure causes and modes found in 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the same subsystem and similar system elements. Although the exact failure mode is not found, analogous failure causes and modes such as 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' causing structural insufficiency, blow-by leakage, poor serviceability, and lack of structure are available and applicable to provide corrective actions relevant for assembly and design for assembly issues. Preventive and detective measures from these cases are transferable and valid for the target context."
Bolted joint design miscalculation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing' with failure cause 'Bolted joint design miscalculation' causing 'Overfunction due to excessive bolt preload'. Retrieved data shows the same failure cause ('Bolted joint design') in very similar contexts: 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', involving sealing and bolted joints with failure modes related to leakage and seal degradation. Although the exact failure mode differs (overfunction due to preload vs leakage/degradation), the underlying cause 'Bolted joint design' is the same, and preventive and detective measures related to bolted joint design from the retrieved context logically apply. No exact match for the exact failure mode 'Overfunction due to excessive bolt preload' but highly similar context in system element and failure cause. No new measures created beyond retrieved data."
Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 while the retrieved context relates to Gas Engine Type 4; the subsystem is the same (Engine Block), the system element is highly related (End cover / Front housing vs. Rear end cover, Front end housing), the function is similar (accommodate/support sealing elements vs seals/crankcase sealing), the failure cause and mode involve 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' but failure effects differ slightly (functional limitation vs leakage). Preventive and detective measures related to geometry tolerance issues for sealing interfaces are applicable and transferable with technical relevance."
"['Inadequate assembly process or design for assembly leading to difficult sensor installation or maintenance', 'Inappropriate front/end cover design not aligning with sensor specifications or mounting requirements', 'Incorrect geometry tolerances or wrong tolerance specifications affecting sensor fitment', 'Insufficient involvement of service and hardware teams during design phase', 'Unsuitable sensor specification not compatible with mounting provisions']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT as the target system Gas Engine Type 6 has the same subsystem (Engine Block), system element (End cover / Front housing) and identical failure mode (Poor serviceability) and failure causes as the retrieved data referring to Gas Engine Type 4 Front end housing (damper housing) with function to provide installation space for sensors. Although the exact product name differs slightly (Type 6 vs. Type 4), the context matches in system element, function and failure characteristics, permitting transfer of relevant measures. Preventive and detective measures identified for failure causes in Type 4 front end housing can be applied to Type 6 end cover / front housing."
"['Assembly errors or poor design for assembly resulting in misaligned sensor mounting points', 'Insufficiently accurate tolerance specifications or geometry deviations', 'Deficiencies in end cover design impacting sensor location accuracy', 'Influence of starter system components affecting sensor positioning', 'Improper bolted joint design causing sensor misplacement']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Although the exact system element 'End cover / Front housing' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Incorrect positioning of sensors' and the specified failure causes is not directly found in the retrieved data, very similar failure modes ('Incorrect positioning of sensors') with matching failure causes such as 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', 'Bolted joint design', 'Crankcase design', 'Starter system influence', and 'Deficiencies in end cover design' are documented for 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' and 'Front end housing (damper housing)' components in 'Gas Engine Type 4' under the same subsystem 'Engine Block'. The functional context of providing installation space and mounting points for sensors is similar. The causes are sufficiently analogous, so preventive and detective measures from these cases are applicable and transferred with adjustment of naming differences. Measures addressing assembly process, design specifications, bolted joint design, geometry and tolerance control, and involvement of service and hardware teams span the related causes and remain relevant to the target context."
"['Assembly or bolted joint design flaws causing excessive vibration transmission', 'Crankcase and front/end cover design weaknesses leading to poor damping', 'Inaccurate geometry tolerances resulting in structural resonance', 'Transient engine operational states (start up, cool down) inducing high vibration', 'Insufficient involvement of hardware and service teams in vibration mitigation design']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: Retrieved context data matches the same product category (Gas Engine), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (front/end cover equivalent: front end housing/damper housing), function (providing installation space and mounting points for sensors), failure mode ('Vibration is too high') and multiple failure causes are highly aligned or directly applicable to the target context of 'End cover / Front housing' in Gas Engine Type 6. Though the product version differs (Gas Engine Type 4 vs. Type 6), the technical nature and function are sufficiently similar, allowing direct transfer of relevant measures without generating new ones."
"['Poor front/end cover structural design lacking robustness for sensor mounting', 'Improper geometry tolerances leading to inadequate support', 'Assembly process not adhering to required structural integrity standards', 'Insufficient integration of control and service teams during design']","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing', function 'Provide installation space and mounting points for sensors at the engine front', failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' and failure causes related to poor structural design, geometry tolerances, assembly process, and team integration. Retrieved data provides detailed measures for a very similar system context: 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' which is analogous to 'End cover / Front housing'. The failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' and related failure causes ('Front/End cover design', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', 'Assembly process / Design for assembly') match closely in function and failure cause. Measures from this retrieved context are technically applicable and valid for the target. The failure cause 'Insufficient integration of control and service teams during design' corresponds to measures addressing team involvement in design. Hence, these measures are transferred with naming variations as appropriate while strictly adhering to provided data."
"Material degradation causing loss of mechanical strength (e.g., due to heat, corrosion or aging)","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode is 'Loss of cable securing function' caused by 'Material degradation causing loss of mechanical strength' in the 'End cover / Front housing' system element within the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6. The retrieved context data only covers failure modes related to sealing degradation, leakage, oil contamination, serviceability, and bolted joint or gasket aging mainly related to sealing or fluid containment functions, primarily within Gas Engine Type 4 and different system elements (rear end cover, crankcase, CCV system, V-room insulation). There is no data addressing cable or wiring securing failure, nor material degradation effects leading to loss of mechanical strength of cable securing elements in the front housing of the engine. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be generated based on the retrieved context data."
Mechanical deformation caused by impact or assembly misalignment,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing', with failure mode 'Functional limitation due to deformation' caused by 'Mechanical deformation caused by impact or assembly misalignment'. The retrieved data contains no exact or close matches for this specific failure cause related to mechanical deformation or impact on the 'End cover / Front housing'. Most retrieved contexts relate to different failure modes (leakage, vibration, structural support issues) or different components within Gas Engine Type 4 or other system elements, or concern design, assembly, or material issues that do not address mechanical deformation by impact or assembly misalignment directly at the End cover / Front housing guiding cable routing. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved data according to the Context Analysis Decision Matrix."
Foreign object ingress or contamination blocking cable passageways,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved data addressing the failure cause 'Foreign object ingress or contamination blocking cable passageways' for the 'End cover / Front housing' guiding and routing cables in the Gas Engine Type 6. All retrieved data relate to different failure modes (such as blow-by leakage, oil leakage, insufficient structural support, vibration issues) or different failure causes, and mostly for Gas Engine Type 4 or sub-elements with dissimilar functions. No exact or similar context match for the requested failure cause and failure mode was found."
Inadequate vibration damping design or fastening leading to loosening of cable clamps,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing' with failure mode 'Functional fluctuation caused by vibration induced loosening' and failure cause 'Inadequate vibration damping design or fastening leading to loosening of cable clamps'. There is no exact match in retrieved data for this exact element, function, failure mode, and cause. However, there is very similar context data about the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem facing a failure mode of 'Vibration is too high' caused partially by 'Front/End cover design' issues relating to vibration and loosening. This context closely matches the target element and failure cause concept (vibration induced failure due to design issues). Measures related to front/end cover design and vibration induced issues in cable/harness fastening are applicable with validated FMEA terms for vibration related loosening. Preventive measures addressing design involvement, adherence to specification, tolerances, FEA, and service team involvement are applicable. Detective measures such as vibration measurement, endurance run, MCE testbench tests, assembly and preload measurement also directly map to detecting loosening and vibration issues. Hence, transferred measures are applicable and coherent."
Excessive clamp force or improper clamp design,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data matches the target failure cause 'Excessive clamp force or improper clamp design' for the system element 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Existing data pertains to other failure causes, system elements, or failure modes mostly regarding sealing, vibration, or structural support in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. No relevant preventive or detective measures addressing cable compression due to clamp force or clamp design were found in the retrieved data."
Seal failure or incorrect geometry causing water ingress along cable routes,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved data specifically addressing the failure mode 'Unintended function: Water ingress path formation' caused by 'Seal failure or incorrect geometry causing water ingress along cable routes' in the 'End cover / Front housing' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem. The retrieved context data mainly covers coolant, oil leakage, blow-by leakage, and sealing degradation in Gas Engine Type 4, mostly for components like crankcase, front end housing (damper housing), cylinder liner assembly, and rear end cover with different failure modes and causes. No exact or sufficiently similar combination of failure cause and failure mode related to water ingress along cable routes is found in the retrieved data to transfer measures. Thus, per the decision matrix, no preventive or detective measures can be generated from the context."
Thermal expansion causing deformation and jamming of movable cable guides,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Sticking at a certain position due to thermal expansion' caused by 'Thermal expansion causing deformation and jamming of movable cable guides' in the 'End cover / Front housing' system element is not found in the retrieved context data, which only contains data mostly about vibration, oil leakage, sealing degradation, bolted joint, and structural support failure causes in Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem and different system elements. There is no direct or similar failure mode/failure cause combination related to cable guides jamming due to thermal expansion in the provided context, nor measures addressing thermal expansion causing deformation for cable guides. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be generated based on the retrieved data."
Assembly error due to unclear design or insufficient instructions,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Assembly error due to unclear design or insufficient instructions' for failure mode 'Incorrect routing direction' of system element 'End cover / Front housing' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not present in retrieved context data which mostly covers different failure modes, causes, system elements, or product type 'Gas Engine Type 4'. There is no exact or similar context match for this specific failure cause and failure mode combination to transfer or reuse measures."
Inadequate bolted joint design causing insufficient preload or loosening under vibration,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loose bolted joints at the end cover interface' caused by 'Inadequate bolted joint design causing insufficient preload or loosening under vibration' in the 'End cover / Front housing' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not explicitly present in the retrieved context data. The retrieved data covers failure modes related mostly to sealing leakage, degradation, oil leakages, and structural support primarily for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although some bolted joint design failure causes are present in the context, they relate to different failure modes mainly leakage or sealing degradation and not loosening under vibration for end cover load transmission function. Thus, no exact or sufficiently similar context with identical system element, function, failure mode and failure cause exists to directly transfer measures. According to the decision matrix, for different context an empty list is returned to avoid introducing measures that may not be applicable or verified."
Material fatigue or improper design leading to stress concentration and crack initiation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Material fatigue or improper design leading to stress concentration and crack initiation' for the end cover/front housing causing structural cracking or deformation due to load stress is similar to the retrieved failure cause 'Front/End cover design' and 'Insufficient structural support' failure mode in Gas Engine Type 4's Engine Block subsystem on front or rear end covers. Despite slight differences in failure mode focus (structural cracking/deformation vs. insufficient structural support), the system element, function, and failure cause (improper design leading to stress concentration) are analogous within the same product category and system context. Hence, preventive and detective measures for 'Front/End cover design' causing 'Insufficient structural support' are applicable and transferable with technical justification."
"Manufacturing tolerances, assembly errors, or thermal distortion causing positional deviation","SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target context involves the 'End cover / Front housing' as part of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Misalignment between end cover and engine block'. Retrieved data covers very similar context for 'Front end housing (damper housing)' or 'Rear end cover' components within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4', mainly focused on structural support, vibration, positioning, and misalignment caused by manufacturing tolerances, assembly errors, or design issues. These contexts are within the same product category (gas engine), subsystem, very closely related system elements (end covers, front housing), and similar failure mode/failure causes (positional deviations due to tolerances, assembly errors, thermal distortion). Thus, applicable preventive and detective measures can be transferred with verification that they address misalignment or positional deviation causes affecting load transmission."
"Inadequate gasket or seal material degradation, improper surface finish or bolted joint design","SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with a failure mode of lack of sealing between the end cover / front housing and the engine block. The retrieved data contains multiple highly relevant matches from Gas Engine Type 4, same Engine Block subsystem and related components such as front end housing (damper housing) and rear end cover, addressing degradation or lack of sealing caused by gasket/sealant degradation, bolted joint and surface finish/design causes. Although not an exact product match, the same system element function and closely related failure causes are covered. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures are transferred from the relevant failure cause and failure mode combinations in the retrieved data, ensuring contextual and technical appropriateness."
Poor joint stiffness or resonance conditions due to structural or design deficiencies,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'End cover / Front housing' and failure mode 'Excessive vibration transmission' caused by 'Poor joint stiffness or resonance due to structural/design deficiencies'. Retrieved data includes very similar context for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Front end housing (damper housing)' which is functionally equivalent to 'End cover / Front housing', failure mode 'Vibration is too high', caused by design deficiencies related to front/end cover design, joint design, assembly process, and geometry tolerances. The similarity in product category, subsystem, system element, function, failure mode and failure cause is high enough to apply measures from the retrieved data. Measures specifically addressing vibration due to poor joint stiffness or resonance (structural/design deficiencies) in the front/end cover design context are relevant and applicable here. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the 'Front/End cover design' and related failure causes for 'Vibration is too high' and 'Insufficient structural support' failure modes are transferred."
"Corrosion buildup, debris ingress, or improper machining tolerances","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data specifically addressing the failure mode 'Sticking or binding of the end cover' caused by 'Corrosion buildup, debris ingress, or improper machining tolerances' for the 'End cover / Front housing' system element in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' system. The retrieved data relates mostly to different failure modes such as 'Insufficient lubrication', 'Blow-by leakage', and 'Vibration is too high', and mainly for 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' or 'Front end housing (damper housing)' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure cause and failure mode combination requested is not found in the context data, even under similar context definitions."
"Design flaws causing load path redirection, such as missing isolation elements or excessive rigidity","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the failure cause 'Front/End cover design' addressing design flaws causing load path redirection in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares strong similarity with retrieved failure causes 'Front/End cover design' for failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Vibration is too high' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' of 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same Engine Block subsystem and product category. The function of structural support and load transmission is analogous, and design flaw-caused load issues correspond to 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Vibration is too high' failure modes. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures found in the retrieved data for these failure causes and failure modes are transferable and applicable here."
Mechanical damage or deformation of end cover mounting points due to impact or assembly overload,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there are no retrieved data entries that exactly or closely match the failure mode 'Loss of attachment capability' caused by 'Mechanical damage or deformation of end cover mounting points due to impact or assembly overload' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data mostly relates to failure modes such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', and 'Poor serviceability' in components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)', 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)', or 'V-room insulation' within 'Gas Engine Type 4' but not the exact or similar failure cause related to mechanical damage or deformation of mounting points for auxiliary device attachment. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be provided from the retrieved context data."
Manufacturing tolerances exceeding limits or deformation during assembly causing misalignment of mounting surfaces,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data matches the exact or similar failure cause of 'Manufacturing tolerances exceeding limits or deformation during assembly causing misalignment of mounting surfaces' for the 'End cover / Front housing' system element in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. All retrieved data relate to other failure modes, causes, or different system elements, or different products (e.g. Gas Engine Type 4) and do not address misalignment due to manufacturing tolerances or assembly deformation for end covers/front housing. No applicable measures for this exact failure cause could be found in the provided context data."
Exposure to aggressive environmental conditions or inadequate surface treatment causing corrosion of attachment interfaces,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Exposure to aggressive environmental conditions or inadequate surface treatment causing corrosion of attachment interfaces' for the system element 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem in a 'Gas Engine Type 6' aimed at failure mode 'Functional interruption by corrosion or material degradation' has no exact or similar context match in the retrieved data. The retrieved FMEA data relates mostly to sealing degradation, oil contamination, leakage, bolted joint design, and serviceability issues primarily within Gas Engine Type 4 or other failure causes/modes that do not exactly match exposure to aggressive environmental conditions causing corrosion at attachment interfaces. No preventive or detective measures addressing corrosion of attachment interfaces or inadequate surface treatment for engine end covers/front housing were found. Therefore, no applicable measures can be generated."
Structural design flaw causing the end cover to transmit excessive loads to auxiliary devices or engine block,SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data is for 'Gas Engine Type 4'; both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and the same subsystem 'Engine Block' with the system element 'End cover / Front housing' or similar 'Front/End cover design'. The failure cause 'Structural design flaw causing the end cover to transmit excessive loads' aligns conceptually with failure causes related to 'Front/End cover design' causing structural issues. Preventive and detective measures related to 'Front/End cover design' for failure modes involving structural inadequacies or overfunction (like 'Insufficient structural support' or 'Vibration is too high') are applicable and transferred accordingly with validation that they address design flaws affecting load transmission.
Assembly errors or foreign material ingress causing impaired fit of auxiliary device interfaces,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Sticking at a certain position / binding' caused by 'Assembly errors or foreign material ingress causing impaired fit of auxiliary device interfaces' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of a 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not exactly matched, nor closely aligned with failure modes and causes in the retrieved data (which mainly cover failure modes like 'Poor serviceability', 'Vibration is too high', 'Lack of structure for support', and sensor-specific positioning issues, predominantly for Gas Engine Type 4 and subsystems related to sensor installation, cable routing, and structural support). The failure cause involves foreign material ingress and impaired fit affecting auxiliary device interfaces, which is not addressed directly in the available context. Furthermore, the retrieved data does not provide direct measures for 'sticking' or 'binding' failure modes related specifically to auxiliary device interfaces in the end cover/front housing for Gas Engine Type 6. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures from the retrieved data can be reliably transferred or adapted to the target context without risking technical inaccuracy or irrelevance."
"Failure of sealing interfaces on the end cover allowing dirt, moisture or fluids to enter auxiliary device mounting area","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode is 'Unintended function - fluid ingress' caused by 'Failure of sealing interfaces on the end cover allowing dirt, moisture or fluids to enter auxiliary device mounting area' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved data covers failure modes such as 'Poor serviceability', 'Degradation of sealing over time', 'Blow-by leakage', and others mostly in Gas Engine Type 4, with failure modes focused on sealing leaks, degradation, and assembly related issues. However, no exact match or sufficiently similar failure cause explicitly addressing 'Failure of sealing interfaces on the end cover allowing dirt, moisture or fluids to enter auxiliary device mounting area' is found. The closest context relates to sealing degradation or leakage in covers or housings but targeted to sealing failure causing leakage of fluids between crankcase or oil contamination, which differs from the auxiliary device mounting area contamination failure cause here. Therefore, per decision matrix, no suitable extracted preventive or detective measures directly address this failure cause in the exact or sufficiently similar context, resulting in an empty measure list."
Design weaknesses such as insufficient material thickness or improper reinforcement,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Design weaknesses such as insufficient material thickness or improper reinforcement' causing 'Structural fatigue cracking' of the 'End cover / Front housing' (engine block subsystem in Gas Engine Type 6) is technically aligned with the failure cause 'Front/End cover design' leading to the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in the 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component of 'Engine Block' in Gas Engine Type 4. Both involve front/end cover design weaknesses causing structural insufficient support or fatigue failures affecting mounting integrity of auxiliary devices. Thus, measures related to 'Front/End cover design' for the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' are directly transferable and applicable, given the same product category (gas engine), subsystem, system element function and failure cause context. No other more exact matches exist; therefore, only the retrieved preventive and detective measures from the 'Front/End cover design' failure cause under 'Insufficient structural support' are used without introducing new data."
Manufacturing defects such as casting porosity or machining inaccuracies,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Manufacturing defects such as casting porosity or machining inaccuracies' causing 'Dimensional inaccuracies impacting fit' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact or similar matches in the retrieved data; the retrieved data mainly addresses failure modes and causes related to leakages, vibrations, structural support, or different failure causes in Gas Engine Type 4 and different system elements. There is no retrieved data specifically addressing manufacturing defects like casting porosity or machining inaccuracies for the End cover / Front housing for the Gas Engine Type 6 or sufficiently similar failure cause and mode combinations in other subsystems or products."
Incorrect assembly procedure or improper fastener torque application,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data for the exact failure mode 'Fastener loosening or failure' caused by 'Incorrect assembly procedure or improper fastener torque application' in the 'End cover / Front housing' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Additionally, the retrieved data is all for different failure modes such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Incorrect positioning of locking pin', etc. in 'Gas Engine Type 4' or other system elements. No relevant or similar failure cause and failure mode context is found for transfer of measures."
Inadequate corrosion protection or environmental sealing,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element End cover / Front housing, function to enable attachment of auxiliary devices, failure mode corrosion leading to material weakening, and failure cause inadequate corrosion protection or environmental sealing. No exact match with retrieved data for corrosion leading to material weakening specifically in End cover / Front housing of Gas Engine Type 6 was found. However, the retrieved data contains highly similar system elements (Front end housing, Rear end cover) and failure causes involving corrosion due to humidity in the engine room and inadequate sealing in Gas Engine Type 4 within Engine Block subsystem. Corrosion protection and sealing measures for similar components are applicable and technically appropriate to transfer to the target context, as corrosion protection and environmental sealing are standard preventive approaches for corrosion-related failure causes in engine housings in the gas engine product category. Hence, preventive measures like painting acc. to RAIP 43200 and detective measures such as endurance run inspections and FPQ part inspections for corrosion detection can be adopted from this similar context."
Manufacturing dimensional deviation (machining tolerances exceeded),"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Loss of dimensional stability' due to 'Manufacturing dimensional deviation (machining tolerances exceeded)' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of Gas Engine Type 6 is not present in the retrieved context. All retrieved data relates to different failure modes (e.g. 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient lubrication', 'Pressure drop is too high', 'Liner contact disruption', 'Blow-by leakage', and 'Coolant leaks') or different causes or components primarily from Gas Engine Type 4 and different failure mode combinations. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be generated from the provided data adhering strictly to the MEASURE REQUIREMENTS and CONTEXT ANALYSIS DECISION MATRIX."
Thermal expansion mismatch between end cover and engine block materials,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no retrieved context data specifically addressing 'Thermal expansion mismatch between end cover and engine block materials' causing 'Functional limitation due to deformation' of the 'End cover / Front housing' in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The available data refers mostly to 'Gas Engine Type 4', different failure causes (e.g., bolted joint design, assembly process), failure modes (e.g., Insufficient clearance, Vibration too high, Liner contact disruption), different component references (rear end cover, flywheel side) and do not cover thermal mismatch issues in front end cover or end cover components. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved context under given instructions."

The retrieved data mainly relates to different failure modes such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Vibration is too high', 'Degradation of sealing over time', or insufficient structural support but not directly to bolt loosening or bolt preload issues in the specified system element and failure mode. Also, the product is a different Gas Engine Type (Type 6 versus Type 4 in retrieved data), and failure cause is specific to fastener preload/fatigue, not discussed in the context. Thus, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred based on the provided context."
Assembly process variability and incorrect torque application during installation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Assembly process variability and incorrect torque application during installation' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' with failure mode 'Functional fluctuation (variable alignment)' does not have any exact or similar context data retrieved that matches the same system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause. All retrieved data relates to different failure modes (e.g., leakage, vibration, incorrect positioning) and different failure causes. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be provided from the retrieved context data."
Use of excessively rigid material or design leading to stress concentration,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Overfunction (excessive stiffness)' caused by 'Use of excessively rigid material or design leading to stress concentration' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of a Gas Engine Type 6, while the retrieved data only covers failure modes related to vibration issues, insufficient structural support, leakage, degradation of sealing, or local vibrations, primarily from Gas Engine Type 4 and different failure causes. No exact or sufficiently similar failure cause with regard to 'excessive stiffness' or stress concentration due to rigidity in the End cover / Front housing is found. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved data."

All retrieved data relates to different failure modes such as vibration issues, blow-by leakage, insufficient structural support, liner contact disruption, or other failure causes and modes in varying components, mostly within Gas Engine Type 4 and different failure mode contexts. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be provided from the retrieved data."

The retrieved context mostly concerns 'Gas Engine Type 4' with different failure modes and causes such as oil leakage, contamination, insufficient lubrication, and degradation of sealing but none targeting corrosion or debris accumulation causing sticking in the end cover or front housing bearing seating area. Hence, no directly applicable or sufficiently similar preventive or detective measures are available from the retrieved context."
Incorrect mating orientation or misalignment during assembly,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved data matches the target failure cause 'Incorrect mating orientation or misalignment during assembly' of the 'End cover / Front housing' system element with the failure mode 'Incorrect directional alignment' in the 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The available data covers mostly different failure modes (e.g., leakage, vibration, positioning) and different causes in Gas Engine Type 4 or related elements. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures exist in the retrieved context for this exact failure cause and system element."
Deformation or dimensional tolerance deviation of end cover resulting in misalignment with engine block,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause is 'Deformation or dimensional tolerance deviation of end cover resulting in misalignment with engine block' in the 'End cover / Front housing' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'; however, all retrieved data relate to 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' or other different system elements or failure causes in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. There is no exact or sufficiently similar context with the same system element, failure mode, and failure cause to transfer or use existing measures. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be generated based on the retrieved context data without violating measure generation rules."
Corrosion or surface wear on mounting flange due to environmental exposure or improper handling,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved data exactly or similarly matches the failure cause 'Corrosion or surface wear on mounting flange due to environmental exposure or improper handling' for the system element 'End cover / Front housing' in the Gas Engine Type 6 engine block subsystem with the specific failure mode 'Functional limitation due to flange surface damage'. The closest retrieved contexts relate to sealing or leakage failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 and different components (e.g., piston cooling jet, rear end cover, crankcase), but none address flange surface corrosion or wear for end covers in Gas Engine Type 6. Thus, no applicable preventive or detective measures exist in the retrieved data for this specific target context."

The retrieved data only contains failure modes related to oil leakage, poor serviceability, sealing degradation, vibration, bolted joint design in other components or slightly related failure modes but none addressing thread damage due to cross-threading or corrosion in end covers or front housing bolted connections. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or used from the retrieved context."
Corrosion buildup or debris accumulation at mating surfaces causing adhesion,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: No retrieved data explicitly matches the exact failure mode 'Sticking at a certain position (seized end cover)' caused by 'Corrosion buildup or debris accumulation at mating surfaces causing adhesion' for the 'End cover / Front housing' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data mainly covers failure modes related to sealing degradation, oil leakage, design issues, vibration, contamination, and poor serviceability largely from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with different failure modes and causes. No applicable preventive or detective measures for corrosion or debris adhesion at mating surfaces specifically exist in the retrieved context. Therefore, no measures can be generated under the provided instructions."
Improper design of orientation features or inadequate assembly instructions,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no retrieved context data exactly or sufficiently matching the failure cause 'Improper design of orientation features or inadequate assembly instructions' for the failure mode 'Incorrect direction of assembly' of the system element 'End cover / Front housing' in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data relates mainly to other failure modes such as 'Lack of structure for support', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Poor serviceability', 'Incorrect positioning of sensors', or 'Incorrect positioning of locking pin' in Gas Engine Type 4 with different failure causes and different components. Also, no similar failure cause about orientation features or assembly instructions design specifically matching the requested failure cause was found in any of the documents. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be provided beyond the scope of the retrieved context data."
Design lacking sufficient structural support causing end cover to bear engine operational loads,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the 'Engine Block' subsystem and the system element 'End cover / Front housing' related to structural support function. The retrieved data shows very similar contexts in 'Gas Engine Type 4' for 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component within the 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure modes 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Lack of structure for support', and failure cause 'Front/End cover design' linked to insufficient structural support of the end cover or front housing. Despite the target being a different gas engine type, the product category, subsystem, system element function, failure mode, and cause are sufficiently similar, making the preventive and detective measures directly applicable without modification. The retrieved measures explicitly address insufficient structural support due to design deficiencies in the front/end cover, aligning well with the target failure cause of lack of sufficient structural support causing unintended load bearing by the end cover. Therefore, these measures are transferred as preventive and detective actions."

The retrieved data covers related failure modes (e.g., 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Structural support fails') but none directly address material fatigue/fracture in baseframe of Gas Engine Type 6. Also, the product is different (Gas Engine Type 6 vs Gas Engine Type 4), and the failure cause is not represented in the retrieved context data. Therefore, no measures can be transferred or applied."
"Casting defects such as porosity, inclusions, or improper heat treatment during manufacturing","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: No retrieved data matches the exact failure cause 'Casting defects such as porosity, inclusions, or improper heat treatment during manufacturing' for the system element 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' or sufficiently similar context. All provided failure causes and measures relate to other components, failure causes, or different failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4 or different subsystems. Therefore, no valid preventive or detective measures can be generated from the retrieved context for this specific failure cause."
Exposure to corrosive environments without adequate surface protection or maintenance,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no exact match or sufficiently similar failure cause related to 'Exposure to corrosive environments without adequate surface protection or maintenance' causing 'Corrosion induced material degradation' in the 'Baseframe' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block. The retrieved context data relates to other failure modes such as oil contamination, structural support insufficiency, blow-by leakage, sealing degradation, and coolant leakage primarily on different system elements (e.g., front end housing, crankcase, rear end cover) and different failure causes. Also, the failure cause here explicitly involves corrosion from environmental exposure without protective measures, which is not reflected in the retrieved contexts. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures from the retrieved data are applicable without risking technical inaccuracy."
Thermal stresses during operation or due to transient thermal cycles exceeding material yield limits,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved FMEA data exactly or similarly matching the failure cause 'Thermal stresses during operation or due to transient thermal cycles exceeding material yield limits' leading to 'Permanent deformation or warping' of the system element 'Baseframe' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data primarily addresses failure causes related to vibration, assembly, bolted joint design, lubrication, sealing degradation, and liner deformation in Gas Engine Type 4, not thermal stress-induced permanent deformation or warping specific to the baseframe in Gas Engine Type 6."
Inadequate bolted joint design or improper assembly torque and stamina under vibration loads,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: No retrieved context data specifically matches the TARGET SYSTEM CONTEXT of 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Baseframe', function 'Support engine block structural loads during operation', failure mode 'Fastener loosening or failure', and failure cause 'Inadequate bolted joint design or improper assembly torque and stamina under vibration loads'. All retrieved data pertains to 'Gas Engine Type 4', different system elements (e.g., V-room insulation, Rear end cover, Crankcase, Front end housing), failure modes related to leakage or vibration generally but not exactly matching fastener loosening due to inadequate bolted joint design or assembly torque. Therefore, per the CONEXT ANALYSIS DECISION MATRIX, this counts as DIFFERENT CONTEXT since no exact or directly transferable similar context with matching failure cause and mode for baseframe fastener loosening is found."
"Welding defects, fatigue cracking at weld seams under cyclic loading","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved data exactly or similarly matches the target failure cause 'Welding defects, fatigue cracking at weld seams under cyclic loading' on the 'Baseframe' system element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data covers other failure modes (primarily leakage and structural support) in 'Gas Engine Type 4' but none concerning baseframe weld or fatigue cracking, and thus no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or used."
Fatigue induced microcracks or intermittent loosening under transient dynamic loads,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Baseframe' supporting structural loads. The failure mode is 'Functional fluctuation - variable stiffness from joint looseness or microcracking' caused by 'Fatigue induced microcracks or intermittent loosening under transient dynamic loads'. Retrieved context data is for Gas Engine Type 4 in the same 'Engine Block' subsystem and related components dealing with vibration-related failure modes due to bolted joint design, assembly issues, fatigue, and transient loads. Although the exact failure cause and element differ, the nature of the failure (joint looseness, fatigue microcracks, vibration) and system function contexts are very close. Therefore, preventive and detective measures for bolted joint design, assembly, and transient loading related vibration failure causes in Gas Engine Type 4 engine block are applicable and transferable with validation. No direct exact matches were found for fatigue microcracks on baseframe in Type 6, but similar joint looseness and vibration failure cause data in the engine block subsystem of Type 4 provide relevant and applicable measures."
Design overreinforcement causing stress peaks and brittleness under dynamic loads,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data exactly or similarly addressing the failure mode 'Overfunction - excessive stiffness leading to stress concentration' caused by 'Design overreinforcement causing stress peaks and brittleness under dynamic loads' on the 'Baseframe' system element with the function to support engine block structural loads. The retrieved data only contains failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', and various leakage or assembly/design issues mainly on other components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover, V-room insulation) in Gas Engine Type 4, while the target is Gas Engine Type 6 Baseframe with a very different failure cause and failure mode not covered. Therefore, by FMEA standard and the provided decision matrix, no measures can be generated from the given data."
Baseframe natural frequency matching engine operational frequencies due to inadequate modal design,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no exact or sufficiently similar failure cause context found for 'Baseframe natural frequency matching engine operational frequencies due to inadequate modal design' related to resonance amplification in the Baseframe of Gas Engine Type 6. The retrieved data mostly covers 'Vibration is too high' and other failure modes in the Engine Block subsystem but for different components (Front end housing, Crankcase, CCV system, Cylinder liner assembly) and different failure causes.

Available data focuses on oil contamination, lubrication, sealing degradation, leakage, and serviceability in components such as crankcase, rear/front end covers, V-room insulation, and oil systems in Gas Engine Type 4. The failure cause in baseframe mounting interfaces due to contamination build-up does not match with these contexts or specific failure causes listed. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated based on the retrieved data."
Material fatigue due to cyclic loading and vibration,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because retrieved data relates to similar failure modes (e.g., 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Degradation of sealing over time') and failure causes related to components within the Engine Block subsystem, but none directly address the exact failure cause of 'Material fatigue due to cyclic loading and vibration' on the Baseframe providing mounting interface for engine block assembly in Gas Engine Type 6. Additionally, no exact or clearly transferable preventive or detective measures for 'Material fatigue due to cyclic loading and vibration' on the Baseframe are present in the retrieved context."
Inadequate material selection or thickness leading to insufficient stiffness,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure cause 'Inadequate material selection or thickness leading to insufficient stiffness' for the system element 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6', although in the same product category and subsystem ('Engine Block'), does not have an exact or similar failure cause in the retrieved data. The retrieved data mostly covers failure causes related to assembly process, bolted joint design, crankcase design, geometry tolerances, and cover designs for various failure modes such as 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', or 'Insufficient lubrication' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. There is no retrieved measure data directly applicable or transferable for material selection or thickness inadequacy causing insufficient stiffness of a baseframe. Therefore, based on the CONTEXT ANALYSIS DECISION MATRIX, the output is empty."
Corrosion or environmental degradation at mounting points,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data specifically addressing the failure cause 'Corrosion or environmental degradation at mounting points' of the system element 'Baseframe' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. All retrieved data relate to other failure causes (mainly relating to sealing, bolted joints, O-Rings, gasket aging, oil and coolant leakages) and other components or system elements within either Gas Engine Type 4 or different functions. Therefore, no directly applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or applied for this exact failure cause and system element."

The retrieved data is mostly from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with different system elements (like V-room insulation, Rear end cover, Front end housing, Cylinder liner assembly), different failure modes (like Oil/Mixture leakage over time, Insufficient lubrication, Vibration is too high, Incorrect positioning of sensors, Insufficient structural support), and different failure causes. No suitable similar context exists because 'Baseframe' as a system element and 'Functional fluctuation - variation in mounting interface alignment' failure mode with the stated failure cause are not found with matching or similar combination in the retrieved data. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be generated from the retrieved context under the FMEA standards."
Overdesign of baseframe thickness or welds,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Overfunction - excessive stiffness causing stress concentration' caused by 'Overdesign of baseframe thickness or welds' in the 'Baseframe' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data contains only similar failure modes related to 'Insufficient structural support', 'Degradation of sealing', 'Vibration is too high', and 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' primarily in 'Gas Engine Type 4' and for different components other than 'Baseframe'. No exact or sufficiently similar context data addresses 'Overfunction - excessive stiffness' or failure cause of 'overdesign of baseframe thickness or welds'. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be generated based on the retrieved data without violating the instructions."
Improper accommodation of thermal expansion and contraction in design,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Unintended function - baseframe deformation under thermal expansion' due to 'Improper accommodation of thermal expansion and contraction in design' on the 'Baseframe' system element in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs significantly from all retrieved failure modes, failure causes, and elements associated mostly with 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Blow-by leakage', 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Incorrect positioning of sensors' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. There is no exact or similar failure cause related to thermal expansion accommodation in the context of baseframe deformation. Therefore, no relevant preventive or detective measures can be transferred or derived from the retrieved data."
Plastic deformation from overload or impact events,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the provided failure mode 'Sticking at a certain value - permanent deformation under load' due to 'Plastic deformation from overload or impact events' in the 'Baseframe' system element of the 'Gas Engine Type 6' and 'Engine Block' subsystem has no exact or similar context match in the retrieved data. The retrieved measures predominantly address failure modes such as 'Insufficient structural support', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Vibration is too high', and 'Degradation of sealing over time' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', and failure causes tied to design, assembly, joint calculations, and sealing degradation rather than plastic deformation from overload or impact events. Since no relevant measures for plastic deformation or overload/impact related failure causes are available in the context data, no preventive or detective measures can be generated based on the retrieved context."
Manufacturing errors in hole placement or drilling angle,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data explicitly matches or is sufficiently similar for the failure cause 'Manufacturing errors in hole placement or drilling angle' of the system element 'Baseframe' with function 'Provide mounting interface for engine block assembly' in Gas Engine Type 6. The retrieved documents mainly address failure causes related to 'design', 'assembly process', 'bolted joint design', 'crankcase design', 'seal degradation', 'leakage', and 'vibration' in Gas Engine Type 4 with other system elements (e.g., V-room insulation, Rear end cover, Front end housing) and different failure modes. Therefore, no valid preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated without creating new measures beyond the retrieved data."
Inadequate structural design of baseframe leading to insufficient stiffness or strength,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Loss of function - Baseframe fails to absorb vibrational forces' caused by 'Inadequate structural design of baseframe leading to insufficient stiffness or strength' in the 'Baseframe' (structural support element) of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related to the failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' in various engine block components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. These retrieved contexts share the same system element identity of structural support components responsible for absorbing or providing structural stiffness. The failure cause of insufficient structural design broadly matches these causes (e.g., 'Crankcase design', 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Bolted joint design', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', 'Front/End cover design'). Although subsystem context or exact naming slightly differs, the technical concepts and risk mitigation measures are applicable to a baseframe with similar function and failure cause in a similar product category (gas engines). Hence, transferred measures are valid and recommended."

Existing data mostly covers 'Oil leakage', 'Degradation of sealing', 'Insufficient structural support', or 'Vibration too high' but not explicitly loosening of bolted joints causing functional vibration fluctuation in the baseframe. Furthermore, no preventive or detective measures specifically addressing fastener preload or intermittent loosening for vibration absorption on baseframes in Gas Engine Type 6 context were retrieved or transferable."
Harmonic excitation frequencies matching the natural frequency of the baseframe due to design or assembly variations,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Baseframe' performing the function of absorbing and distributing vibrational forces. The failure mode is 'Overfunction - excessive vibration resonance amplification' caused by 'Harmonic excitation frequencies matching the natural frequency of the baseframe due to design or assembly variations'. Retrieved data contains very similar failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high' and 'Insufficient structural support' affecting structural components within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of a 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Although the exact system element (Baseframe) and failure cause wording differ, the nature of vibration issues due to design or assembly variations causing resonance and loosening matches closely. Therefore, preventive and detective measures related to design process integration, simulation, tolerance control, bolted joint design, FEA, testbench vibration measurement, endurance runs, and assembly checks from these contexts are applicable and transferred with adjusted terminology for the target context."
Incorrect installation or offset alignment causing unintended load paths,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target context is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Baseframe', function to absorb and distribute vibrational forces. The failure mode 'Unintended function - Baseframe transmits vibrational forces rather than absorbing them' caused by 'Incorrect installation or offset alignment causing unintended load paths' is related to vibration transmission due to assembly or alignment quality issues. Retrieved context data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same 'Engine Block' subsystem but different system elements (front end housings, covers, rear end covers) covering failure causes related to assembly process, design for assembly, bolted joint design, geometry tolerances, with primary focus on structural support and vibration related failure modes. Given the high similarity of failure cause category (incorrect installation/assembly and alignment), and failure effect (unintended vibration transfer), the preventive and detective measures for 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' causing vibration-related failure modes are transferable and applicable to the Baseframe failure cause. Hence, measures addressing assembly process and alignment/installation error are appropriate to carry over."
Inherent design limitations or damage to vibration damping materials (e.g. rubber mounts or isolators),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, Baseframe element with function to absorb and distribute vibrational forces, failure mode 'Sticking at certain vibration level' caused by inherent design limitations or damage to vibration damping materials. Although this exact failure mode and failure cause is not found, there is highly relevant retrieved data regarding 'Vibration is too high' failure mode caused by design and assembly issues related to vibration damping and structural support in Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem components (damper housing, front end housing). The failure cause of vibration damping material damage and design limitations can be associated with known causes like 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Geometry tolerances', 'Bolted joint design', and 'Transient engine operation'. These measures are applicable as preventive and detective measures to reduce or detect issues related to damping limitations and damage. Hence, transferred measures are applicable after validation for baseframe vibration damping limitations in Gas Engine Type 6."
Geometry tolerances or incorrect fabrication causing asymmetrical stiffness in baseframe,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 (different product variant but same product category: gas engines), subsystem Engine Block, system element Baseframe (structural element similar to Front end housing or Rear end cover in function of structural support and vibration absorption). The failure mode 'Incorrect direction - Vibrational forces distributed unevenly due to geometry deviations' is related closely to 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Vibration is too high' failure modes seen in Gas Engine Type 4 context with failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' or 'Geometry tolerances'. These contexts share the failure cause of geometry tolerance deviations affecting structural stiffness and vibration behavior. Preventive and detective measures for those causes in similar structural contexts are applicable and technically relevant to the target failure cause. No exact match data found for Baseframe with this failure mode, but similar system elements with structural vibration and tolerance-based failure causes provide applicable measures."
Fatigue cracking due to high cycle vibration or impact loads,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Fatigue cracking due to high cycle vibration or impact loads' in the 'Baseframe' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no retrieved matching or similar failure cause data related to fatigue cracking or structural cracks in baseframes though there is data on vibration-related issues and design causes in other components in Gas Engine Type 4 but these do not specifically address fatigue cracking in baseframe elements. Hence, no direct or closely similar context measures are available."

The retrieved data relates predominantly to 'Bolted joint design' or 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)' in 'V-room insulation', 'Crankcase', 'Rear end cover', or other engine block components in different failure mode contexts and primarily for Gas Engine Type 4, not for the baseframe element in Gas Engine Type 6. Hence, no exact or similar context match is found for direct measure transfer."
Manufacturing tolerance stack-up causing dimensional deviations,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Loss of alignment' due to 'Manufacturing tolerance stack-up causing dimensional deviations' on the 'Baseframe' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data contains no exact matches or similar failure modes with matching system element (Baseframe), failure mode (Loss of alignment), and failure cause (Manufacturing tolerance stack-up). Available retrieved data pertains mainly to failure modes such as 'Blow-by leakage', 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient lubrication', 'Pressure drop is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Liner contact disruption', and 'Poor serviceability' in components like 'Rear end cover', 'Front end housing', and 'Cylinder liner assembly' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. These do not relate to alignment loss or manufacturing tolerance stack-up on a baseframe. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be derived from the existing context adhering to the specified matrix and measure requirements."

Retrieved data relates only to other failure modes (leakage, vibration, structural support) in Gas Engine Type 4 and different components (V-room insulation, CCV system, Front end housing) with different failure causes and modes. Hence, no directly applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred."
Thermal expansion-induced distortion of the baseframe structure during transient engine operation (start-up and cool-down),"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Thermal expansion-induced distortion of the baseframe structure during transient engine operation (start-up and cool-down)' affecting 'Functional fluctuation of alignment' in 'Baseframe' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no directly matching or similar failure cause and failure mode in the retrieved context data, which only covers different failure causes, failure modes, system elements, or products (mostly Gas Engine Type 4 and other failure modes).

The retrieved data refers mostly to failure causes related to 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', and 'Degradation of sealing' in 'Gas Engine Type 4', often involving different specific components (e.g., front end housing, rear end cover, V-room insulation) and different failure causes related primarily to insufficient rigidity or leakage, not excessive rigidity or over-reinforcement. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures from the retrieved context data apply to the target failure cause regarding over-reinforcement and uneven load distribution in the Baseframe of Gas Engine Type 6."
Material defects or high vibration levels causing crack initiation and propagation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Baseframe' but the retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' within the same subsystem 'Engine Block' and related system elements (e.g., front end housing, rear end cover, crankcase) dealing with structural support and vibration induced failure modes. The failure cause 'high vibration levels causing crack initiation and propagation' corresponds closely to 'Vibration is too high' failure mode and 'Insufficient structural support' causes in the retrieved context. Also, material defects (not explicitly listed) can partially map to design/specification/FEA-focused preventive measures. Thus, preventive and detective measures related to vibration-induced structural issues in similar engine block components are applicable and transferable with technical alignment."
Excessive mechanical loading or improper bolted joint design causing plastic deformation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: There is no retrieved context data matching the exact failure cause 'Excessive mechanical loading or improper bolted joint design causing plastic deformation' of the 'Baseframe' system element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data mainly concerns failure modes and causes related to sealing, leakage, bolted joint design, and structural support in different components (e.g. V-room insulation, crankcase, rear end cover, flywheel side) and mostly for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The baseframe element and the specific failure cause about plastic deformation under mechanical loading is not present, and thus no direct or similarly applicable measures can be transferred from the given context data. Product category is the same (gas engine), subsystem is the same (engine block), but system element and failure cause are different, so per the decision matrix, no measures can be generated from retrieved data."

The retrieved information covers mostly sealing, oil leakage, structural support, and bolted joint design in 'Gas Engine Type 4' but not fatigue failure of welds or bolted joints due to cyclic loading in a baseframe context. Therefore, no measures can be derived from the provided context."
Overloading beyond design limits causing plastic deformation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Overloading beyond design limits causing plastic deformation' of the system element 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block and failure mode 'Functional limitation - Baseframe deformation' has no exact or similar retrieved context data. The retrieved data comprises different failure causes such as design issues, assembly, bolted joint design etc., related to failure modes like 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Degradation of sealing over time', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', and others in 'Gas Engine Type 4'.

All retrieved data pertains to different failure modes (mostly vibration, insufficient structural support, leakages), different components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover, CCV system, Cylinder liner assembly), or different failure causes, and none address impact damage to the baseframe. Therefore, no applicable measures are available from retrieved context data."

All retrieved data pertains to different failure modes such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Degradation of sealing over time', or 'Insufficient structural support', mostly related to other components (e.g. V-room insulation, Rear end cover, Crankcase) in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure cause and system element do not overlap, and the failure mode is unrelated, so no preventive or detective measures from the retrieved context apply."
Design without adequate compliance or damping leading to stress concentration,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure mode is 'Overfunction - Baseframe excessive rigidity' caused by 'Design without adequate compliance or damping leading to stress concentration' in 'Baseframe' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data only covers failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Degradation of sealing', 'Oil/Mixture leakage', and other modes but none directly address 'excessive rigidity' or 'lack of compliance/damping' of a baseframe structure in any Gas Engine Type. There is no exact or sufficiently similar context (failure mode and failure cause matching) for 'Baseframe' or design without compliance/damping causing excessive rigidity. Therefore no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or suggested from the retrieved data without risking technical inaccuracy."

All retrieved failure causes and associated measures relate to other failure modes such as oil contamination, leakage, degradation, blow-by leakage, assembly issues, bolted joint design, and structural support within 'Gas Engine Type 4' or similar elements but do not specifically address corrosion due to environmental exposure or corrosion protection failure on a baseframe or equivalent component. Hence, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated from the retrieved data without creating new measures beyond the extract."
Corrosion or contamination causing seizing of mounting bolts,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there are no retrieved data addressing the failure cause 'Corrosion or contamination causing seizing of mounting bolts' for the Baseframe system element in the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6. The retrieved context covers various failure causes related mostly to sealing, bolted joint design, oil leakage, and similar issues for Gas Engine Type 4 but does not include any data on corrosion or contamination causing bolt seizure for the Baseframe or mounting bolts.

Design deficiencies in baseframe damping material or structure,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Design deficiencies in baseframe damping material or structure' related to 'Loss of vibration isolation function' in 'Baseframe' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact or similar failure cause documented in the retrieved data. The retrieved contexts mostly address 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Vibration is too high' failure modes in different components (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover) within Gas Engine Type 4, none covering damping material or structural design deficiencies of baseframe vibration isolation function. Thus, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be generated from the retrieved data."
"Transient engine operation conditions (start-up, cool down) causing unexpected resonance","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode relates to 'Vibration levels exceed isolation capacity' caused by 'Transient engine operation conditions causing unexpected resonance' on the Baseframe of the Engine Block in Gas Engine Type 6, while the retrieved data primarily covers different failure modes mainly related to crankcase ventilation (CCV system), vibration on 'Front end housing (damper housing)' in Gas Engine Type 4, or failures in V-room insulation also for Gas Engine Type 4, with no exact or closely matching failure mode or system element context. Therefore, no directly applicable preventive or detective measures exist in the retrieved data for this specific failure cause of the baseframe vibration isolation function."
Improper bolted joint design or insufficient preload torque during assembly,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because retrieved data contains no exact or similar match for the failure mode 'Bolted joint loosening' caused by 'Improper bolted joint design or insufficient preload torque during assembly' on the system element 'Baseframe' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. All retrieved contexts relate to different failure modes (e.g., oil leakage, degradation of sealing, insufficient structural support) or different components (like V-room insulation, crankcase, rear end cover). Although there is bolted joint related data, it refers to different failure modes not directly matching 'Bolted joint loosening' due to improper design or preload torque on the baseframe. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or directly applied based on the Context Analysis Decision Matrix."
Geometry tolerances stack-up inducing stiffness mismatch and resonance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Geometry tolerances stack-up inducing stiffness mismatch and resonance' is closely related to 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' in the retrieved context. Both concern geometry tolerance stack-up issues leading to excessive vibration or overfunction modes in engine block related components (although the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 and the retrieved data primarily concerns Gas Engine Type 4, the subsystem 'Engine Block' and vibration-related failure modes are analogous. The system element 'Baseframe' function 'Isolate engine-induced vibrations' relates functionally to components like 'Front end housing (damper housing)' which also manage vibrations and structural integrity. Hence, preventive and detective measures for 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' applicable to vibration-related failure modes can be transferred and adapted without introducing new measures beyond the retrieved data."
Wear or degradation of isolation material over time and environmental exposure,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Functional fluctuation - intermittent vibration isolation performance' due to 'Wear or degradation of isolation material over time and environmental exposure' on the 'Baseframe' in the 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not represented in retrieved data. The retrieved context exclusively covers failure modes related to sealing degradation, bolted joint design, vibration too high, blow-by leakage, oil leakage, and similar on different system elements within 'Gas Engine Type 4', not addressing deterioration of vibration isolation materials or baseframe vibration isolation function. There is no exact or similar context for failure cause or failure mode to transfer measures."
Incorrect sensor installation or interface alignment errors,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT due to no exact or sufficiently similar failure cause matching 'Incorrect sensor installation or interface alignment errors' for 'Baseframe' system element in 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data primarily addresses sensor installation issues and vibration related failures for other engine block components (Rear end cover, Front end housing, CCV system) in 'Gas Engine Type 4', but none explicitly relates to 'Baseframe' or the specific failure cause. Preventive and detective measures must align strictly with retrieved data; thus no measures can be applied from the different system element and failure cause context."
Fatigue or cracking in baseframe structure due to persistent high vibration,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Structural support deformation affecting isolation' caused by 'Fatigue or cracking due to persistent high vibration' in the 'Baseframe' of 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block does not exactly or sufficiently match any failure modes, failure causes, or system elements in the retrieved context. The closest contexts relate to 'Vibration too high', 'Insufficient structural support', or other failure modes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' for different components (e.g., Front end housing, CCV system, Crankcase), but none explicitly address fatigue or cracking failure cause in the baseframe structure for vibration isolation. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures from the retrieved data can be directly or securely transferred or adapted according to the strict system similarity definitions."
Misalignment in baseframe mounting or uneven load distribution,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no exact or similar combination of System Element 'Baseframe', Function 'Isolate engine-induced vibrations from external structure', Failure Mode 'Incorrect vibration isolation directionality' and Failure Cause 'Misalignment in baseframe mounting or uneven load distribution' for Gas Engine Type 6 in 'Engine Block' subsystem within the retrieved data. All retrieved failure causes and measures are related to structural support, bolted joints, assembly, and vibration issues but none directly address the failure cause of misalignment or uneven load distribution in the baseframe for vibration isolation directionality in the given system context."
Design or material resonance at baseframe natural frequencies not accounted during FEA,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Design or material resonance at baseframe natural frequencies not accounted during FEA' causing 'Sticking at certain vibration modes' in the 'Baseframe' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches functionally and conceptually to vibration-related failure causes such as 'Crankcase design', 'Bolted joint design', and general 'Design' related causes in 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4'. While exact failure cause is not found, the vibration failure causes in a very similar context and subsystem provide applicable and transferable measures. These focus on design verification, involvement of service/design teams, and FEA plus testing, which are relevant and appropriate to address resonance and vibration related design failures."
Severe bolt loosening or fracture due to fatigue or assembly error,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data matches the exact combination of Product (Gas Engine Type 6), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Baseframe), Function (Isolate engine-induced vibrations), Failure Mode (Functional interruption - baseframe detachment), and Failure Cause (Severe bolt loosening or fracture due to fatigue or assembly error). All retrieved data relates to other failure modes like Oil/Mixture leakage, Degradation of sealing, Insufficient structural support in different components or systems mostly within Gas Engine Type 4. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be generated from the provided context."
Structural cracking or fracture of baseframe material induced by thermal fatigue,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no exact or sufficiently similar failure cause for 'Structural cracking or fracture of baseframe material induced by thermal fatigue' in the 'Baseframe' system element and function 'Transfer thermal loads' within the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' is available in the retrieved data. The retrieved data primarily covers failure causes in other components (e.g., bolted joint design, crankcase design, assembly process) around insufficient structural support, leakage, vibration, or sealing degradation in Gas Engine Type 4, but none specifically address thermal fatigue cracking or fracture of a baseframe material. Therefore, no relevant preventive or detective measures can be provided."
Corrosion or surface degradation reducing thermal conductivity of the baseframe interface,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT - The target failure cause 'Corrosion or surface degradation reducing thermal conductivity of the baseframe interface' in 'Baseframe' of 'Engine Block' subsystem for Gas Engine Type 6 relates to corrosion and thermal conduction issues at a structural interface. The retrieved context data contains no exact matches or even similar failure causes related to corrosion or surface degradation affecting thermal conduction for the Baseframe or analogous structural interfaces. Existing data mainly covers failure causes concerning coolant flow, sealing degradation, bolted joint design, or structural support in other specific components (liner, crankcase, housing) and does not address corrosion-related thermal conductivity reduction in baseframes. Therefore, no relevant preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved context under established FMEA standards."
Bolt or fastener loosening caused by vibrational fatigue and thermal cycling,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Functional interruption due to baseframe loosening' caused by 'Bolt or fastener loosening caused by vibrational fatigue and thermal cycling' on the 'Baseframe' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6', which does not exactly match any failure mode and failure cause combination in the retrieved context. The retrieved data mainly concerns 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Degradation of sealing', 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support' failure modes on other system elements (e.g. crankcase, V-room insulation, rear end cover, front end housing) within Gas Engine Type 4. Although some causes relate to bolted joint design and bolt loosening due to vibration, they appear under different failure modes and system elements, with no exact or sufficiently similar match to the target context. Given the strict applicability criteria, no preventive or detective measures can be reliably transferred or generated without exceeding scope or inventing new data."
Differential thermal expansion causing intermittent gaps or variable contact pressure at the baseframe interface,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Differential thermal expansion causing intermittent gaps or variable contact pressure at the baseframe interface' within the 'Baseframe' system element and function 'Transfer thermal loads from engine block to mounting points' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact or similar matches in the retrieved data. All retrieved failure causes and measures relate to different failure causes, system elements (e.g., bolted joint design, liner landing design, sealant design), or different failure modes (e.g., insufficient structural support, vibration, sealing degradation, leakage) primarily for Gas Engine Type 4 and different components. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved data set."
Incorrect material selection with too high thermal conductivity causing unintended heat sinking affecting engine thermal management,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Overfunction - excessive thermal conduction' caused by 'Incorrect material selection with too high thermal conductivity' in the 'Baseframe' of Gas Engine Type 6, whereas all retrieved data relate to different failure modes (mostly inadequate or too low heat transfer, leakage, vibration, lubrication, or combustion gas containment) in different system elements within Gas Engine Type 4. No retrieved preventive or detective measures specifically address failure causes related to incorrect material selection causing excessive thermal conduction for baseframe or similar components."
Lack of proper electrical insulation between engine block and baseframe creating unintended electrical paths,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: No retrieved context data explicitly addresses the failure cause 'Lack of proper electrical insulation between engine block and baseframe creating unintended electrical paths' or the failure mode 'Unintended function - electrical conduction through baseframe' for the 'Baseframe' system element or similar electrical insulation issues. Existing retrieved data focus on flow blockages, structural support failures, sealing, vibration, and other mechanical/thermal issues in Gas Engine Types 4 and associated subsystems. There are no matching or sufficiently similar failure modes or causes concerning electrical insulation or unintended conduction in the retrieved context."
Thermal interface material degradation causing thermal contact resistance locking heat transfer at a suboptimal level,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Thermal interface material degradation causing thermal contact resistance locking heat transfer at a suboptimal level' in the system element 'Baseframe' for the function 'Transfer thermal loads from engine block to mounting points' and failure mode 'Sticking at a certain temperature value' has no directly matching or even similar failure cause, failure mode, or function in the retrieved context data, which mostly covers 'Cylinder liner assembly', 'Crankcase', or 'Front end housing (damper housing)' components with different failure causes related to cooling, leakage, vibration, or contact issues. There is no preventive or detective measure in the retrieved context about thermal interface material degradation or baseframe thermal interface management. Therefore, no measures can be adopted or transferred."
Improper design or assembly causing thermal bridges redirecting heat away from mounting points,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: No retrieved context data matches the target system context specifically for the Baseframe system element within the Engine Block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6 focused on the failure mode 'Incorrect direction of thermal load transfer' caused by 'Improper design or assembly causing thermal bridges'. The retrieved documents concern other failure modes such as leakage, vibration, structural support, and heat transfer but not thermal load direction issues or thermal bridging in a Baseframe. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred without violating the measure requirements."
Design omissions or tolerance stack-up errors causing missing or weak attachment points,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 and subsystem Engine Block with system element Baseframe having failure mode 'Lack of structure for support' caused by design omissions or tolerance stack-up errors causing missing or weak attachment points. Although exact system element (Baseframe) does not appear in retrieved data, the failure mode and cause align closely with retrieved failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Lack of structure for support' in the Engine Block subsystem of a Gas Engine Type 4. The functional context (providing attachment/support structure) and failure cause (design or tolerance omissions/errors) are analogous and preventive/detective measures for design omissions and tolerance stack-up also apply logically. Thus, applicable measures are transferred from similar failure causes related to design and tolerance issues on structural components in Engine Block of similar gas engines."
Design not optimized for maintenance access or assembly process deficiencies,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' and failure cause 'Design not optimized for maintenance access or assembly process deficiencies' occurring in the Engine Block subsystem, Baseframe element with function 'Provide channels and attachment points for routing auxiliary systems'. Retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 and same subsystem Engine Block but different system element (CCV, Front end housing, etc.) with similar failure mode 'Poor serviceability' caused by 'Design for maintenance' and 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' which closely aligns with 'Design not optimized for maintenance or assembly process deficiencies'. The product category (gas engine) and subsystem are the same, thus transferred measures are applicable with some contextual adaptation, avoiding non-relevant measures."
Repeated mechanical or thermal loading exceeding baseframe endurance limits,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode is 'Structural fatigue failure' in the 'Baseframe' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6', caused by 'Repeated mechanical or thermal loading exceeding baseframe endurance limits'. The retrieved context data primarily covers different failure modes (e.g., 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Degradation of sealing over time') and different system elements (e.g., Front end housing, Rear end cover, Crankcase, CCV system), in Gas Engine Type 4. There are no exact matches for the failure mode and failure cause in the Baseframe of Gas Engine Type 6 or a highly similar context. Measures related to vibration, bolted joint design, assembly processes, sealing degradation, and oil leakage do not specifically address structural fatigue failure due to repeated mechanical or thermal loading in the baseframe. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or applied based on the given retrieved context."
Incorrect material selection or insufficient thermal compensation in design,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Deformation due to thermal expansion' with failure cause 'Incorrect material selection or insufficient thermal compensation in design' on the system element 'Baseframe' for function 'Provide channels and attachment points for routing auxiliary systems' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block has no matching or similar failure cause and failure mode data available in the retrieved context. All retrieved data relate to different failure modes such as 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Poor serviceability', 'Blow-by leakage', and other failure causes unrelated to material selection or thermal compensation. Therefore, no relevant preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated from the retrieved data."
Baseframe supporting loads beyond design scope due to auxiliary system changes or modifications,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the retrieved data 'Gas Engine Type 4' belong to the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem (Engine Block). The system element 'Baseframe' relates functionally to structural support and attachment points similar to components like 'Front end housing', 'Rear end cover', and other engine block structural parts in the retrieved data. The failure cause involving baseframe supporting loads beyond design scope due to auxiliary system changes or modifications is conceptually similar to causes like 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Bolted joint design', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', and 'Design changes' that lead to 'Insufficient structural support' or 'Overfunction' in related components. Hence, preventive and detective measures from these similar contexts are transferred and adapted for the target failure cause and mode, ensuring their applicability to overloading beyond design scope due to auxiliary system modifications on the baseframe."
Variable tightening of bolted joints or connection elements due to assembly errors or loosening,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data matching exactly or similarly the failure cause 'Variable tightening of bolted joints or connection elements due to assembly errors or loosening' for the system element 'Baseframe' in the Gas Engine Type 6 product and Engine Block subsystem with the failure mode 'Functional fluctuation – variable stiffness'. The retrieved data mostly concerns failure modes related to oil leakage, degradation of sealing, insufficient structural support, and bolted joint issues in Gas Engine Type 4 but not addressing assembly errors or loosening causing variable stiffness in the baseframe. Thus, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved data."
Misalignment or improper installation of auxiliary systems causing load vectors not properly distributed,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Incorrect direction of load transfer' caused by 'Misalignment or improper installation of auxiliary systems causing load vectors not properly distributed' in the 'Baseframe' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' does not exactly match any failure mode or failure cause from the retrieved data, which primarily covers failure modes such as 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification', 'Incorrect positioning of sensors', and others related to different failure causes. The retrieved context does not include direct matches or sufficiently similar failure mode and cause combinations involving 'Misalignment or improper installation of auxiliary systems' or incorrect load direction in the 'Baseframe' component and 'Provide channels and attachment points for routing auxiliary systems' function. Therefore, per the context analysis decision matrix, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated from the retrieved data."
Inadequate bolted joint design leading to insufficient clamping force and joint relaxation under thermal cycling,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Inadequate bolted joint design leading to insufficient clamping force and joint relaxation under thermal cycling' for the system element 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block does not have exact matches in the retrieved data, but very similar failure cause 'Bolted joint design' is present in multiple failure modes within 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Despite the different product generation and exact failure mode, the system element identity (bolted joint/baseframe), failure cause (bolted joint design issues), and subsystem context (engine block) are sufficiently similar, making the preventive and detective measures for bolted joint design applicable and technically valid. Therefore, measures from retrieved data referencing 'Bolted joint design' are transferred."
Material selection not compensating for differential thermal expansion coefficients causing internal stresses and warping,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode is 'Functional limitation due to thermal expansion mismatch' caused by 'Material selection not compensating for differential thermal expansion coefficients causing internal stresses and warping' in the 'Baseframe' of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data covers failure modes related mostly to 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Insufficient lubrication', and other failure causes on components such as 'Front end housing', 'Rear end cover', 'V-room insulation' and different failure causes and design issues, but none directly or closely related to thermal expansion mismatches, material selection for thermal expansion compensation, or warping/stress due to thermal mismatch specifically for the baseframe component or similar function. There are no exact or similar context matches concerning material selection compensating for thermal expansion in the baseframe or engine block with the given failure mode and cause. Therefore, according to the FMEA Measure Requirements and the system similarity definitions, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated from the retrieved context data."
High vibration levels amplified by inadequate damping and weak geometric tolerances causing cyclic loading,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' and the context data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', the subsystem is exact ('Engine Block'), and the system element 'Baseframe' is very similar in function and failure mode context to 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and related structural components. The failure mode 'Functional interruption due to fatigue damage' caused by 'High vibration levels amplified by inadequate damping and weak geometric tolerances causing cyclic loading' aligns closely with 'Vibration is too high' failure mode and the failure causes related to geometric tolerances and vibration from the retrieved data. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures from the vibration-related failure causes and geometry tolerances can be reused and adapted."
Transient engine operation conditions such as startup and cooldown causing thermal gradients and uneven expansion,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause relates to transient engine operation causing thermal gradients and uneven expansion in the Baseframe of Gas Engine Type 6, focusing on dimensional stability under thermal/mechanical stress. Retrieved data mostly concerns Gas Engine Type 4 with failure modes linked to gas flow, pressure, combustion mixture, or liner contact disruption, none of which exactly match the baseframe dimensional stability failure mode or cause. Also, no measures related to baseframe or its dimensional stability during transient thermal cycles were found. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred."
Design overcompensation with overly thick sections or hardening treatments causing brittleness and crack initiation sites,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Overfunction causing excessive stiffness' with the specific failure cause 'Design overcompensation with overly thick sections or hardening treatments causing brittleness and crack initiation sites' on the 'Baseframe' system element in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem is not present in the retrieved context data. The retrieved measures address different failure modes like 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration too high', 'Blow-by leakage', and others with different failure causes and do not cover the design overcompensation causing brittleness or excessive stiffness issues. Hence, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or applied."
Baseframe resonance caused by geometric tolerances deviations and insufficient structural damping,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Baseframe resonance caused by geometric tolerances deviations and insufficient structural damping' is highly related to the failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' and structural vibration issues in similar engine block components ('Front end housing', 'Rear end cover') within the Gas Engine product category. Both the system element (baseframe vs. front end housing) and the failure cause relate to vibration induced by geometric tolerances and structural damping issues. Although the exact system element is 'Baseframe' versus 'Front end housing (damper housing)', the engine block subsystem, product category and vibrational failure context match closely, allowing a transfer of applicable measures focused on geometry tolerances and structural damping. The preventive and detective measures retrieved for 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' and related vibration causes in the engine block subsystem for Gas Engine Type 4 systems are applicable here after validation."
Plastic deformation due to exceeded yield strength under combined mechanical and thermal loads,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data matches the exact or similar failure cause of 'Plastic deformation due to exceeded yield strength under combined mechanical and thermal loads' for the 'Baseframe' system element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6. All retrieved failure causes and measures relate to other failure causes such as vibration, leakage, bolted joint design, assembly, and sealing degradation but none on plastic deformation or yield strength related dimensional instability in baseframe."
Incorrect prediction of thermal expansion direction due to flawed FEA modeling or simulation assumptions,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause ('Incorrect prediction of thermal expansion direction due to flawed FEA modeling or simulation assumptions') and failure mode ('Incorrect direction of thermal deformation') for the system element 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' have no exact or similar matching failure cause and failure mode combinations in the retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' or other subsystems. The retrieved context mostly addresses failure causes related to structural support, bolted joint design, sealing leakage, vibration, or sensor positioning, none addressing flawed FEA prediction of thermal expansion direction causing dimensional instability."
Structural deformation caused by mechanical overload or impact during operation or transportation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Loss of service access due to blockage or deformation of structural openings' caused by 'Structural deformation caused by mechanical overload or impact during operation or transportation' for the 'Baseframe' system element and its function 'Enable service access to engine block through structural openings' in Gas Engine Type 6 does not have exactly matching or sufficiently similar failure mode and cause pair in the retrieved context data which mainly covers 'Insufficient structural support', 'Vibration is too high', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', and other failure modes related to structural support or sealing in 'Gas Engine Type 4' and different system elements. No preventive or detective measures specifically addressing structural deformation due to mechanical overload/impact or blockage of openings are available."
"Environmental exposure causing corrosion, oxidation, or material embrittlement of baseframe material around openings","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: No exact or sufficiently similar failure cause related to 'Environmental exposure causing corrosion, oxidation, or material embrittlement of baseframe material around openings' on the Baseframe system element for the function 'Enable service access to engine block through structural openings' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' subsystem 'Engine Block' found in retrieved context data. Existing retrieved failure causes and measures relate mainly to sealing degradation, bolted joint design, assembly processes, oil leakage, vibration, structural support, and other design-related causes for Gas Engine Type 4 and different system elements. No preventive or detective measures specifically addressing corrosion/material degradation due to environmental exposure around access openings of a baseframe are available, so per instructions no new measures can be created."
Improper assembly procedures or foreign object intrusion during engine assembly or prior service activities,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Functional interruption of service access due to accidental sealing or obstruction caused by improper assembly procedures or foreign object intrusion' on the 'Baseframe' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' does not exactly match any failure mode or failure cause in the retrieved data, nor is there a similar failure mode with matching failure cause on the baseframe or equivalent system element. The retrieved data mostly addresses design and assembly issues related to structure support, vibration, sealing leakage, liner contact, and poor serviceability in other engine subsystems and components (e.g., CCV system, Cylinder liner assembly, V-room insulation) primarily in Gas Engine Type 4 and different failure modes. No preventive or detective measures are available in the retrieved data that specifically or sufficiently match the failure cause 'Improper assembly procedures or foreign object intrusion' leading to functional interruption of service access in the baseframe for Gas Engine Type 6."
"Improper hinge or latch design, contamination, or mechanical wear causing binding or jamming of access covers","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The exact combination of system element (Baseframe), specific function (Enable service access through structural openings), failure mode (Sticking at position of structural openings), and failure cause (Improper hinge or latch design, contamination, or mechanical wear causing binding/jamming) in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not found exactly in the retrieved context data. However, closely related failure modes such as 'Poor serviceability' with causes linked to 'Front/End cover design', 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', and 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' in similar engine block components (e.g., front end housing, covers) in the Gas Engine Type 4 product, Engine Block subsystem, provide analogous measures. These causes reflect design and assembly issues that can cause jamming/binding or poor opening function of covers or service access points, which corresponds to the target failure cause. Preventive and detective measures from these contexts are relevant and applicable, especially those addressing design involvement of service and hardware teams, specification adherence, tolerance control, FEA, and assembly/process controls. Therefore, these measures are transferred as they technically apply and help reduce or detect improper design, contamination, or wear-induced binding in structural openings."
Design oversight in baseframe layout or manufacturing deviations affecting alignment of structural openings,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data explicitly addresses the failure mode 'Incorrect direction or misalignment of access openings relative to required service tools or personnel ergonomics' caused by 'Design oversight in baseframe layout or manufacturing deviations' in the 'Baseframe' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data primarily covers 'Insufficient structural support', 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Incorrect positioning of sensors or locking pins', 'Vibration', and 'Poor serviceability' for other system elements (e.g., damper housing, rear end cover, V-room insulation) in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Therefore, no exact or sufficiently similar context data exists to transfer preventive or detective measures for this particular failure cause and failure mode in the target system."
"Gaps, improper sealing, or inadequate design of access openings failing to protect internal engine components","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved data matches the exact failure cause 'Gaps, improper sealing, or inadequate design of access openings failing to protect internal engine components' for the system element 'Baseframe' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Also, the provided context data mostly refers to sealing issues in crankcase, cylinder head interfaces, blow-by systems, and oil/coolant leakages in 'Gas Engine Type 4' with different failure causes and failure modes. There are no applicable preventive or detective measures addressing structural openings or ingress of contaminants via baseframe access openings to transfer from similar subsystem or slightly different failure causes."
"Material fatigue, repeated maintenance modifications, or improper retrofit enlarging openings beyond design limits","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Material fatigue, repeated maintenance modifications, or improper retrofit enlarging openings beyond design limits' related to 'Overfunction by structural openings becoming excessively large' in the 'Baseframe' of 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' does not have any exact or similar failure mode and failure cause matches in the retrieved context. Retrieved data predominantly addresses sealing degradation, vibration issues, insufficient structural support, or other failure causes in different components (e.g. front/rear end housing, crankcase) and different failure modes. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or used."

The failure cause 'V-room design' and the failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' have direct counterparts with provided preventive and detective measures in the retrieved data, so these can be applied without modification."
Inappropriate material selection with insufficient thermal resistance,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved context directly contains failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' for system element 'V-room insulation' in 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' which matches the target system context 'Gas Engine Type 6', same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause (inappropriate material selection with insufficient thermal resistance). The presence of preventive and detective measures in the exact matching context allows direct reuse without modification."
Design for maintenance inadequacies resulting in improper servicing and degradation,"EXACT_MATCH because the target context matches exactly the retrieved failure mode, failure cause, system element, subsystem and product family: 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' in 'V-room insulation' of 'Engine Block' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' matches exactly 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture' for 'V-room insulation' in 'Engine Block' for 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure cause 'Design for maintenance inadequacies' corresponds exactly to 'Design for maintenance'. Thus, only the measures from this exact match are used."

Although the product variant differs (Type 6 vs Type 4), the system element and failure scenario are identical and within the same product category – gas engines engine block subsystem V-room insulation transient condition. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the exact failure cause + failure mode context are directly applicable."
Combustion system characteristics inducing excessive temperatures near the V-room insulation,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem, V-room insulation, function 'Insulates the gas from heat of the crankcase (20)', failure mode 'Too high temperature gradient of intake mixture', failure cause 'Combustion system characteristics inducing excessive temperatures near the V-room insulation') exactly matches the retrieved context data from Gas Engine Type 4 with the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause.

Both products belong to the same category (gas engines) and share the same subsystem and element context. Therefore, preventive and detective measures for 'V-room design' causing 'Mechanical failure of V-room' can be transferred and applied to the target system."
Material selection,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with identical subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'V-room insulation', function 'Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase', failure mode 'Mechanical failure of V-room', and failure cause 'Material selection' matching exactly the retrieved data which relates to 'Gas Engine Type 4'.

Design for maintenance,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'V-room insulation', function and failure mode matching perfectly, and failure cause 'Design for maintenance' also matching an existing context in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Same product category (gas engine) and subsystem with exact system element and failure cause. Hence, measures from Gas Engine Type 4 context for 'Mechanical failure of V-room' due to 'Design for maintenance' are directly applicable after review. Naming variations do not apply as the element and failure cause names are identical. The retrieved preventive and detective measures from the Gas Engine Type 4 data for this failure cause are relevant and applicable."
Casting tolerances (Crankcase),"SIMILAR_CONTEXT as the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'V-room insulation', function 'Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase', failure mode 'Mechanical failure of V-room', and failure cause 'Casting tolerances (Crankcase)'. The retrieved context matches the same subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause but from 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Both belong to the same product category (gas engines) and very similar functional contexts. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data are applicable to the target system context without modification."

Since the failure cause is material-related degradation and the context is within the engine block subsystem sealing function, transferring applicable preventive and detective measures from these similar failure causes in 'Gas Engine Type 4' V-room insulation failure mode context is justified. Measures specific to mechanical failure (e.g. design or manufacturing process causes) are excluded since the failure cause target concerns material degradation.

Bolted joint design deficiencies or bolt loosening from vibration leading to compromised clamping force,"EXACT_MATCH because the target is the Gas Engine Type 6, subsystem Engine Block, system element V-room insulation, function Sealing to lower crankcase, failure mode Functional limitation due to improper bolted joint integrity, and failure cause Bolted joint design deficiencies or bolt loosening from vibration causing compromised clamping force matches exactly the failure cause 'Bolted joint design' and 'Bolt loosening from vibration' under failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' (similar function and failure effect related to sealing and bolted joint integrity) retrieved from Gas Engine Type 4, which is in the same product category with highly similar subsystem and element context. The naming variations and close functional alignment allow applying exact-match context measures without deviation. Preventive and detective measures address only the failure causes 'Bolted joint design' and 'Bolt loosening from vibration' as retrieved, strictly following the provided data without adding new measures."
"O-Ring aging, thermal mechanical degradation, or chemical degradation affecting sealing performance","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'V-room insulation' sealing crankcase to prevent leakage. The retrieved data comes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure modes related to degradation of sealing over time, including O-Ring aging and thermal/chemical degradation affecting sealing. Although the system element 'V-room insulation' is not explicitly listed, the sealing function and failure cause (O-Ring aging, thermal mechanical and chemical degradation) closely match those in sealing components such as 'Rear end cover', 'Front end housing', and other sealing interfaces within the engine block. Since the product category, subsystem, function, failure mode, and causes are very similar, but the exact component differs, a SIMILAR_CONTEXT decision applies and measures related to O-Ring aging and sealing degradation from the retrieved context are transferred and adapted as appropriate. These measures are relevant to sealing components within the engine block and address sealing performance degradation and related preventive/detective strategies."
Casting tolerances and crankcase dimensional variation causing misfit at sealing interface,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'V-room insulation' for sealing at the crankcase interface. The failure cause 'Casting tolerances and crankcase dimensional variation causing misfit at sealing interface' relates to dimensional and tolerance issues at the sealing interface.

These causes are directly applicable to casting tolerance variation issues that affect sealing and misalignment. Hence, preventive and detective measures from these similar contexts are transferred as they are technically relevant to control dimensional variation and casting tolerance issues causing misfit at sealing interfaces."
Backfire or combustion irregularities causing pressure spikes affecting seal integrity,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Backfire or combustion irregularities causing pressure spikes affecting seal integrity' in the 'V-room insulation' component of 'Gas Engine Type 6' (Engine Block subsystem) dealing with sealing to lower crankcase relates functionally and contextually to causes related to pressure events, combustion irregularities, and sealing integrity issues described in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' context for similar engine block components (e.g., crankcase sealing components affected by combustion events and transient engine operation). Although an exact failure cause match for backfire-induced pressure spikes is not found, similar failure causes such as 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)', 'Combustion system', 'Crankcase design', and sealing related causes in the retrieved data are related in concept and scope. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures for these similar causes and failure modes have been transferred and adapted as they address combustion-induced pressure effects on sealing and flow integrity in the engine block and related components, which is relevant for V-room insulation sealing function under pressure spikes."
"Incorrect assembly, design for maintenance faults, or improper O-Ring installation","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is a 'Gas Engine Type 6' while retrieved data predominantly refers to 'Gas Engine Type 4', but within the exact same subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'V-room insulation', with matched function 'Sealing to lower crankcase'. The failure mode in target 'Loss of sealing due to assembly or maintenance errors' relates closely to retrieved failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage' or 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' which implies sealing loss leading to leakage issues. The retrieved data includes failure cause 'Design for maintenance' and 'Design for assembly process (bolted joint)', 'O-Ring design', relevant for failure causes stated in the target: 'Incorrect assembly, design for maintenance faults, or improper O-Ring installation'. Therefore, measures related to design for maintenance, design for assembly, and O-Ring design from retrieved data are applicable and technically valid to transfer for preventive and detective measures concerning assembly and maintenance faults in V-room insulation sealing. Measures specific to exact failure causes in the target that match those in retrieved data are used, avoiding unrelated causes. Hence this qualifies as SIMILAR_CONTEXT with partial but sound transfer of applicable measures."

Although the exact system element 'V-room insulation' and the specific failure cause 'Intake pressure spikes during load rejection' are not explicitly found, the context of pressure-induced sealing failure due to transient engine operation and intake system pressure anomalies is shared. Therefore, preventive and detective measures related to intake system design, crankcase design, transient engine operation effects, and sealing design from the retrieved context for similar failure modes are transferred as relevant and applicable, respecting the measure requirements."

Product type is similar (same product category, gas engines), subsystem and system element are identical, and the failure details match perfectly. Thus, by the matrix, preventive and detective measures from Gas Engine Type 4 context for the same function and failure cause are transferable and applicable to the target system context, considering naming conventions are consistent and the subsystem is identical."
Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation' in the 'V-room insulation' for sealing to upper crankcase with failure mode 'Oil/Mixture leakage' in Gas Engine Type 6 has no exact or similar matching failure cause with preventive or detective measures in the retrieved data. The retrieved context covers mainly failure causes related to pressure, design, maintenance, flow insufficiency, or system pressure exceedance, none related to backfire induced failure cause. Additionally, the failure mode and cause combination with 'Oil/Mixture leakage' by backfire is not addressed in the available data, which mostly pertains to Gas Engine Type 4 and different failure modes. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be generated based on the retrieved data for this specific failure cause."

Given the identical system element, function, failure mode and cause combination in a closely related product within the same product category (gas engines), it is appropriate to transfer the relevant preventive and detective measures from the retrieved context data. The slight product type difference (Type 6 vs Type 4) is unlikely to diminish relevance as the core design and failure mechanisms are similar, especially for V-room insulation sealing issues. No new measures are introduced beyond the retrieved context data."

The retrieved context has exact matches in subsystem, system element, function, failure mode, and failure cause but mostly for 'Gas Engine Type 4', which is the same product category and highly similar system context. The difference lies only in engine type version. Therefore, all retrieved measures for 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the same relevant context and failure cause are applicable and valid for transfer, without any contradictory data. Hence, preventive and detective measures from 'Gas Engine Type 4' for 'Material selection' causing 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time' in 'V-room insulation' sealing to upper crankcase are used."

Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Backfire due to non-optimal engine operation' in the 'V-room insulation' element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem for 'Gas Engine Type 6' is not available exactly in the retrieved data. However, closely related failure causes such as 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' causing issues in the 'V-room insulation' component related to flow disturbances, insufficient air/gas/mixture, or temperature gradient in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' are retrieved. These failure causes share the subsystem, system element, and engine operation transient conditions that can lead to backfire. Therefore, preventive and detective measures linked to 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' and related combustion or mixture disturbances in the V-room insulation for Gas Engine Type 4 are transferred as applicable, given the product category and component similarity. The measures align technically with preventing and detecting issues caused by transient engine operation and related combustion effects that could indirectly cause backfire and consequent leakage over time."

Both products belong to the same product category (Gas Engines) and the functional, failure mode, and failure cause context is directly transferable. Thus, measures from Gas Engine Type 4 with the exact subsystem/system element/function/failure mode/failure cause are applicable. Preventive measures 'O-Ring specification' and 'O-Ring calculation' from the retrieved data are valid. Detective measures 'Validation plan for V-room', 'MCE Functional Testing (O-Ring inspection)', and 'Field validation (O-Ring inspection)' found for the Gas Engine Type 4 sealing to upper crankcase scenario apply too.

However, a very similar context exists in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system within the 'Engine Block' subsystem for failure modes involving 'Degradation of sealing over time' and 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' related to 'O-Ring aging'. Preventive and detective measures for 'O-Ring aging' causing sealing degradation and blow-by leakage are applicable and transferable to the target context because the functional conditions, subsystem, system element identity, and failure cause closely match.

These are from the same product category (gas engines) and system element function, although for a slightly different engine type and exact failure mode wording variant ('Leakage of blow-by gas' and 'Leakage of blow-by gas over time'). Measures related specifically to gasket and O-ring design were retrieved and are applicable.

Design for vibration,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'CCV (blow-by) system', failure mode 'Poor serviceability', and failure cause 'Design for vibration'. The retrieved data largely comes from 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the exact same subsystem and system element, failure mode, and failure cause but sometimes differing in function (e.g., provides installation space for sensors or cable routing). The product category is the same (gas engines) and the subsystem and component are identical. The failure cause and failure mode alignment is exact, although the function 'Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system' differs slightly from the retrieved functions focused on installation space and serviceability, the failure cause justification fits similarly in this system element. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data for 'Design for vibration' failure cause under 'Poor serviceability' failure mode for the CCV system are applicable and transferred with validation. Measures related specifically to other failure modes or other failure causes are excluded as per instructions."
Assembly process / Design for assembly,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' with failure mode 'Poor serviceability' and failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' does not have an exact match in the retrieved data (which is from 'Gas Engine Type 4'). However, the system element, failure mode and failure cause match exactly in a different product within the same product category and subsystem. The function differs (target function is 'Not exceed a specific pressure difference in system' whereas retrieved data mostly relates to installation space for sensors or cable routing). Despite the different function, the failure cause and mode involving assembly process and design for assembly is applicable and relevant. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from the exact failure mode and cause but different function context in the same product category and subsystem can be transferred."

The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', same system element 'CCV (blow-by) system', same failure mode 'Poor serviceability' and failure cause 'Design for maintenance', but function differs ('Provides installation space for sensors' or 'cable routing'). However, due to same system element and failure cause in the same product category (gas engines) and subsystem, the preventive and detective measures are applicable and relevant to the target context after verifying they address the failure cause 'Design for maintenance' only (preventive) and the failure mode + cause combination (detective). No additional measures outside retrieved context are created."

Retrieved data is for Gas Engine Type 4, while target is Gas Engine Type 6. The measures are applicable and transferable with naming variation allowance."
Inadequate CCV (blow-by) system design resulting in poor sealing or structural weakness,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' matches the same system element and function to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4', but with a different engine type version. The failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment' and cause 'Inadequate CCV (blow-by) system design resulting in poor sealing or structural weakness' closely aligns with 'CCV (blow-by) system design' failure cause in the failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment' or 'Oil leakage to environment over time'.

Gasket and O-ring design deficiencies such as wrong material selection or improper sealing dimensions,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with a focus on the CCV (blow-by) system in the Engine Block subsystem. The failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment' caused by 'Gasket and O-ring design deficiencies (such as wrong material selection or improper sealing dimensions)' is closely related to failure causes and modes involving gasket and O-ring design in the Gas Engine Type 4 within the Engine Block, though the failure mode context is slightly different (oil leakage vs. condensation or blow-by leakage). The failure cause 'Gasket and O-ring design' is addressed by preventive and detective measures found in multiple retrieved failure modes related to sealing degradation, blow-by leakage, oil leakage, and condensation forming in CCV systems. Measures remain applicable, considering the similarity in product category, component function (direct oil sealing and return), and failure cause nature. Therefore, applicable measures for gasket and O-ring design deficiencies from retrieved data are adapted here."

There is no exact match for this exact failure mode and cause combination, but there are highly relevant and similar contexts in Gas Engine Type 4 for the CCV (blow-by) system within the Engine Block subsystem that detail preventive and detective measures for the failure cause 'Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.)' causing failure modes involving blocking or disturbance of the flow path obstructing oil or gas flow over time. The function and subsystem are aligned and the failure cause matches well (oil deposit buildup reducing permeability), although the failure mode wording differs slightly (too little oil draining over time vs. blocking/disturbance of flow path). Since the product category, subsystem, system element, and failure cause are the same or very similar, and the failure mode relates to flow path hindrance/blocking by deposits, the measures are transferable and applicable. Measures strictly address the failure cause and failure mode combinations involving oil deposit buildup on the CCV filters or mesh. Hence, preventive and detective measures retrieved for 'Oil deposit build up (residue on filter mesh and elements etc.)' in the context of the CCV (blow-by) system in Gas Engine Type 4 are applicable for Gas Engine Type 6 without modifications."
Crankcase design issues causing inadequate pressure differential for oil return,"EXACT_MATCH because the target failure mode 'Too little oil draining over time' and failure cause 'Crankcase design issues causing inadequate pressure differential for oil return' exactly match failure mode 'Too little oil draining over time' and failure cause 'Crankcase design' in the same subsystem (Engine Block), same system element (CCV (blow-by) system), same product family (Gas Engine Type series) with directly applicable retrieved context data."

The retrieved context includes directly matching failure mode and failure cause for Gas Engine Type 4 in the Engine Block's CCV system with the same failure mode and cause. Hence, exact preventive and detective measures can be used directly."

Therefore, only the preventive and detective measures from the retrieved data with the exact match context are used."
O-ring aging causing loss of sealing integrity,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'CCV (blow-by) system' matches closely to retrieved context 'Gas Engine Type 4', 'Engine Block', also involving sealing degradation due to 'O-Ring aging' related to oil leakage modes. The failure mode 'Oil leakage to environment over time' caused by 'O-ring aging' corresponds well to 'Degradation of sealing over time' and 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)' failure modes with the cause 'O-Ring aging' in the same subsystem and similar functions in the retrieved data. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from these similar contexts are applicable and technically relevant here, with naming variations allowed between 'Gas Engine Type 4' and 'Gas Engine Type 6' and slight variation in failure mode description but same failure cause and system element."

There is no exact match for this failure cause and failure mode combination in the retrieved context for Gas Engine Type 6. However, there is highly relevant and very similar context from Gas Engine Type 4 CCV (blow-by) system and Engine Block subsystem addressing 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' as a failure cause for similar failure modes such as 'Exceeds the oil concentration limit', 'Disturbance/hindrance of flow path', and 'Oil leakage over time'. The failure cause 'Maintenance (oil & filter & oil level)' corresponds semantically to 'Inadequate maintenance including oil and filter levels leading to seal wear and leakage' in the target context. Both contexts relate to oil system maintenance effects on sealing and leakage. Measures for maintenance-related failure causes in retrieved data are applicable without change because they target maintenance to prevent seal wear and leakage. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are transferred from the retrieved context with adjusted focus to the exact failure mode of oil leakage over time."

The retrieved context relates primarily to 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'System pressure exceeding limits', 'Insufficient air/gas/mixture', or 'Vibration is too high' in components not identical to 'Vibration isolation', and failure causes differ significantly (e.g. bolted joint design vs. loosening of bolted joints under cyclic loads is partially related but context and failure mode differ). Thus, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred based on strict context matching rules and provided data."
"Design flaws in bolted joint or mount geometry tolerances, crankcase and housing design not optimized for vibration damping, assembly errors leading to misalignment, improper torque on fastening components","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' versus retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4', with the same subsystem 'Engine Block', system element function 'vibration isolation' related to vibration transmission issues in similar bolted joint, mount and crankcase design aspects. Failure mode 'Overfunction (Excessive vibration transmission)' closely matches retrieved failure mode 'Vibration is too high' and relevant failure causes match as well (design flaws in bolted joint, mount geometry tolerances, crankcase design, assembly errors, improper torque). Measures from the similar failure mode/failure causes context in Gas Engine Type 4 Engine Block can be applied with relevance and technical correctness."
"Isolator material hardening, contamination or degradation restricting movement, mechanical binding due to improper clearances in assembly","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved data directly matches or sufficiently corresponds to the failure cause 'Isolator material hardening, contamination or degradation restricting movement, mechanical binding due to improper clearances in assembly' of the 'Vibration isolation' system element in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. All retrieved data are related to different failure modes (mainly leakage or general vibration issues) and different system elements with no overlap in isolator material or vibration isolation function. Thus, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred from the retrieved context."
"Inadequate design incorporating natural frequency of mounts, resonance phenomena caused by geometry and material interaction, assembly tolerance stack-up inducing vibrational hotspots","SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system 'Gas Engine Type 6' shares the same subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation' with the retrieved data where vibration-related failure modes (e.g., 'Vibration is too high') in the engine block subsystem of Gas Engine Type 4 have been documented. The failure cause involving inadequate consideration of natural frequency, resonance phenomena, and assembly tolerance stack-up are analogous to failure causes related to 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification', and design-related aspects influencing vibration in the retrieved data. Thus, applicable preventive and detective measures for these failure causes can be transferred and adapted, considering the vibration and resonance related aspects for vibration isolation in the engine block."
"Degradation or damage of vibration isolator material (e.g., elastomer aging, cracking)","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Degradation or damage of vibration isolator material (e.g., elastomer aging, cracking)' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem does not have matching failure cause data in the retrieved context, which mostly covers vibration related causes such as design issues, bolted joint design, assembly process errors, or sealing degradation in Gas Engine Type 4 and similar but distinct failure causes and modes. There is no exact or sufficiently similar failure cause linked to material degradation or aging of vibration isolator materials in the retrieved data for transfer. Hence, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be generated from the provided context."
Incorrect material selection or improper design tolerances causing insufficient damping,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Incorrect material selection or improper design tolerances causing insufficient damping' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' in Gas Engine Type 6 'Engine Block' subsystem and failure mode 'Functional limitation of vibration isolation (reduced damping efficiency)' has no exact match in the retrieved data. However, highly similar failure modes related to vibration issues ('Vibration is too high') within the same subsystem (Engine Block), similar product category (Gas Engine), and similar failure causes related to design and tolerances were found. Measures related to design specifications, tolerance adherence, FEA, involvement of interdisciplinary teams, and vibration measurement for detecting issues are applicable and technically valid as preventive and detective measures for the target failure cause. Hence, measures are transferred from similar context involving vibration-related failure modes and failure causes related to design and tolerances in the engine block."
Assembly process faults such as improper mounting or misalignment of isolation mounts,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure cause is 'Assembly process faults such as improper mounting or misalignment of isolation mounts' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved context data includes failure causes related to assembly process / design for assembly for vibration-related failure modes in Gas Engine Type 4, but specifically for different system elements (e.g., Front end housing damper housing, CCV system) and failure mode details ('Vibration is too high', 'Lack of structure for support', etc.). There is no exact match for 'Vibration amplitude fluctuation exceeding specification' caused by improper mounting or misalignment of vibration isolation mounts in Gas Engine Type 6. The data is from a different product variant and system element identity (no direct reference to vibration isolation mounts or their assembly in Gas Engine Type 6). Also, no measures specific to assembly faults on vibration isolation mounts were retrieved. Therefore, no relevant preventive or detective measures can be generated that comply strictly with measure requirements and using only retrieved context data in exact or similar context."
Design changes or manufacturing deviations resulting in overly stiff isolation components,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure mode 'Overfunction (excessive stiffness in isolation mounts)' caused by 'Design changes or manufacturing deviations resulting in overly stiff isolation components' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6' differs from the retrieved contexts, which focus on failure mode 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', or other modes primarily in 'Gas Engine Type 4' and different system elements such as 'Front end housing', 'Rear end cover', or 'V-room insulation'. None of the retrieved data specifically address failure causes related to overly stiff vibration isolation mounts or design/manufacturing deviations causing excessive stiffness in isolation components. Therefore, no exact or sufficiently similar context exists to transfer measures applicable to this very specific cause and failure mode combination."
Crankcase or engine block resonance frequencies coinciding with engine vibration frequencies due to design or geometry tolerance deviations,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause involves 'Unintended vibration resonance due to resonance frequencies coinciding with engine vibrations caused by design or geometry tolerance deviations' in 'Vibration isolation' system element in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Retrieved context data only covers related or different failure modes and failure causes such as 'Contact to crankshaft', 'Oil leakage', 'Insufficient clearance', 'Vibration is too high' but all in Gas Engine Type 4 and other system elements. There are no exact matches or highly analogous failure mode + cause pairs related to resonance frequencies or vibration isolation design for fatigue damage prevention. Hence, no measures can be transferred or generated based on the retrieved context."
Improper orientation of isolation mounts due to assembly errors or design oversight,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no retrieved context data explicitly relates to 'Vibration isolation' system element with failure cause 'Improper orientation of isolation mounts due to assembly errors or design oversight' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' engine block subsystem; existing data relates mainly to vibration issues, assembly errors, or design causes only tangentially for other elements (e.g., front end housing, bolted joints, sensor positioning) and different failure modes/functions; no exact or similar context match found to transfer measures appropriately without violating instruction to not create new measures beyond retrieved data"
Failure or breakage of isolation mount hardware or bolted joints due to fatigue or assembly issues,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no exact or similar matching failure cause data related to 'Failure or breakage of isolation mount hardware or bolted joints due to fatigue or assembly issues' for the 'Vibration isolation' system element in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' subsystem 'Engine Block'. All retrieved failure causes and measures are for different failure modes (e.g., leakage, sealing degradation, or vibration exceeding sensor specs) or different system elements than 'Vibration isolation' mounts. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or applied based on the retrieved data."
Coupling between isolated components via bolted joints with improper preload or design leading to vibration amplification,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Coupling between isolated components via bolted joints with improper preload or design leading to vibration amplification' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element to prevent fatigue damage from engine vibrations with failure mode of 'Vibration isolation subsystem resonance coupling' is not found in the retrieved context data. The retrieved data contains related causes and effects about bolted joint design and vibration issues in similar subsystems but do not match the exact failure cause or system element related to vibration isolation resonance coupling. Although the general domain is gas engine engine block subsystem, the specific cause and failure mode context is unique and measures for bolted joint design in other failure modes (like oil leakage, vibration too high, etc.) do not fully address resonance coupling related to vibration isolation. Hence, no direct or similar context measures are applicable per FMEA measure generation rules."
Assembly process errors impacting vibration damping components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 and the subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Vibration isolation), function (Maintain structural integrity under dynamic vibration loads), failure mode (Vibration amplitude exceeds design limits), and failure cause (Assembly process errors impacting vibration damping components) are conceptually very close to failure mode 'Vibration is too high' caused by 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' in 'Front end housing (damper housing)' component of the Engine Block in Gas Engine Type 4. Although not an exact match in product type and system element name, the failure mode and failure cause share high similarity and fall under the same product category and subsystem context of engine block vibration issues due to assembly errors affecting vibration damping or structural integrity. Therefore, the relevant preventive and detective measures from that context apply and make technical sense here."
Material fatigue or wear of vibration isolators or dampers,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause is 'Material fatigue or wear of vibration isolators or dampers' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data contains no exact or similar failure cause or failure mode related to material fatigue or wear of vibration isolators or dampers, nor is there any mention of vibration isolators or dampers explicitly. The existing retrieved failure causes pertain primarily to design, assembly, bolted joints, and sealing issues for components such as front end housing, crankcase, V-room insulation, and not specifically vibration isolators or dampers or their material fatigue/wear. Also, the product generation is different (Gas Engine Type 4 versus Type 6). Given no relevant or applicable measures in the retrieval that address material fatigue or wear of vibration isolators or dampers, no direct preventive or detective measures can be generated according to the imposed rules."
Transient engine operation conditions such as start-up and cool-down inducing variable dynamic loads,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved data matching the exact system element 'Vibration isolation' with the same failure mode 'Functional fluctuation in vibration isolation performance' caused by 'Transient engine operation conditions such as start-up and cool-down' in the 'Gas Engine Type 6' or similar product or function context. The retrieved data mostly relate to CCV (blow-by) system, V-room insulation, or general vibration causes in Gas Engine Type 4 with different failure modes and system elements. No directly applicable preventive or detective measures addressing vibration isolation transient effects under dynamic loads were found."
"Geometry tolerances not meeting specification, leading to misalignment and compromised vibration isolation","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation' focused on maintaining structural integrity under dynamic vibration loads. The failure mode 'Insufficient structural support due to design tolerance deviations' with failure cause 'Geometry tolerances not meeting specification' closely matches failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and failure cause 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' as well as 'Vibration is too high' caused by 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The system element differs slightly in naming ('Vibration isolation' vs 'Front end housing' or 'Rear end cover'), but both belong to the Engine Block subsystem and address structural support and vibration-related function failures caused by geometry tolerance deviations. Therefore, preventive and detective measures from these highly similar contexts are applicable and transferable with technical validity."
Incorrect bolted joint preload or over-tightening altering vibration isolation characteristics,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Incorrect bolted joint preload or over-tightening altering vibration isolation characteristics' in the context of 'Overfunction causing excessive damping stiffness' of 'Vibration isolation' in 'Gas Engine Type 6' and 'Engine Block' subsystem has no exact or similar matching failure cause, failure mode, or function in the retrieved data which mostly covers failure modes like 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Vibration is too high', 'Degradation of sealing over time', and 'Insufficient structural support' for different system elements and functions within Gas Engine Type 4 or closely related contexts. Therefore, preventive and detective measures specific to the target failure cause cannot be generated from the retrieved data."
Design flaws in crankcase or housing geometry causing vibration bypass,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no exact match or sufficiently similar context found. The target failure cause is a 'Design flaws in crankcase or housing geometry causing vibration bypass' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' function in the Gas Engine Type 6 engine block subsystem. The retrieved data predominantly relates to other failure causes such as 'Crankcase design' or 'Bolted joint design' with failure modes like leakage, insufficient clearance, structural support, or vibration too high in Gas Engine Type 4 and does not specifically address design flaws in crankcase or housing geometry causing unintended vibration transmission bypass. Measures related to vibration design or crankcase design do not clearly reference vibration isolation or vibration bypass caused by geometry flaws in the crankcase or housing relevant to the target failure cause. Therefore, per the FMEA measure generation rules and the system similarity definitions, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be generated from the retrieved context."
Inadequate damping design or insufficient modal analysis during design phase,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is a Gas Engine Type 6 with Engine Block subsystem and Vibration isolation element facing failure cause of inadequate damping design or insufficient modal analysis during design. Retrieved data is from Gas Engine Type 4 Engine Block subsystem, with similar vibration-related failure modes related to resonance, damping, and structural design, permitting transfer of measures on vibration design and modal analysis aspects despite minor differences in system element and exact failure cause wording."
Improper installation or design of isolation mounts leading to directional stiffness mismatch,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is Gas Engine Type 6 with subsystem Engine Block and system element Vibration isolation having a failure mode of Incorrect vibration isolation direction caused by Improper installation or design of isolation mounts leading to directional stiffness mismatch. The retrieved data does not have an exact match on failure mode or failure cause but contains related vibration-related failure modes (e.g., vibration too high) in the same subsystem and system element context (engine block, vibration-related components). Hence, preventive and detective measures from similar vibration-related assembly and design causes are transferable and applicable after verification."
"Degradation or failure of vibration isolator material or components due to aging, fatigue, or environmental exposure (temperature cycles, oil contamination)","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with reasoning: The target failure cause 'Degradation or failure of vibration isolator material or components due to aging, fatigue, or environmental exposure (temperature cycles, oil contamination)' in the system element 'Vibration isolation' and function 'Dampen transient vibration events during engine start-up and shut-down' of Gas Engine Type 6 does not have any exact or sufficiently similar retrieved context data that address vibration isolator material degradation or failure as failure cause. The retrieved context data mainly cover failure causes related to bolted joint design, assembly process, sealing degradation, oil contamination, vibration too high due to design or assembly issues, or oil leakage in Gas Engine Type 4 and related subsystems. Although related to vibration or sealing in the engine block, none explicitly match the failure cause of isolator material/component degradation or failure due to aging, fatigue or environmental exposure, nor the system element identity as 'Vibration isolation'. Therefore, based on the defined decision matrix, no preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated from the existing data."
Material hardening or contamination causing increased isolation stiffness reducing damping performance during transient vibration events,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Material hardening or contamination causing increased isolation stiffness reducing damping performance during transient vibration events' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' does not exactly match any failure cause or combination from the retrieved context data. The retrieved data contains failure causes related mainly to design, assembly, bolted joint, and transient operations causing 'Vibration is too high' or other failure modes in different components or system elements but none related specifically to material hardening or contamination causing increased stiffness in vibration isolation components. Also, the system element 'Vibration isolation' and function 'Dampen transient vibration events' with failure cause 'material hardening or contamination' is not found in retrieved data, so exact or similar context match is not met. Hence, no relevant preventive or detective measures can be transferred or generated from retrieved context data."
"Mechanical failure of vibration isolator (e.g., cracking, detachment, or mounting failure) during engine start/stop cycles","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Functional interruption (complete failure of isolation element)' caused by 'Mechanical failure of vibration isolator (e.g., cracking, detachment, or mounting failure) during engine start/stop cycles' on the 'Vibration isolation' element in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of the 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data includes failure modes and causes related to vibration amplitude being too high, oil leakage, assembly process or design for assembly issues, and structural support failure primarily from Gas Engine Type 4 and different system elements such as front end housing, CCV, crankcase, and piston cooling jets. No exact match or sufficiently similar failure cause related specifically to mechanical failure of vibration isolators or isolator cracking, detachment or mounting failure was found in the data. Thus, no applicable preventive or detective measures are available from retrieved context."

The retrieved data relate to different system elements, failure modes, or failure causes primarily in Gas Engine Type 4, with no measures specific to vibration isolation and transient temperature gradient effects on stiffness or damping. Also, no directly transferable preventive or detective measures extracted that address the specified failure cause specifically for vibration isolation under transient thermal/mechanical loads."

Retrieved data mainly covers failure modes like 'Vibration is too high' in damper housings or 'Insufficient structural support' and leakage modes in other components of Gas Engine Type 4. No direct matches or clearly applicable similar failure cause and mode pairs for vibration isolation stiffness overfunction in this product and subsystem are found.

This specific failure cause and precise system element context for resonance of isolators at transient frequencies during engine start/shut-down is not present in the retrieved context data. The retrieved data includes vibration-related failure modes such as 'Vibration is too high' mostly affecting 'Front end housing (damper housing)' and other engine block elements in 'Gas Engine Type 4', but not vibration isolators or natural frequency mismatches causing resonance. Because no exact match or sufficiently similar context with the same system element and failure cause is found, and the failure cause specifically relates to vibration isolator resonance (a different subsystem element than retrieved data), no measures can be transferred or generated without introducing new measures."

The retrieved data is from 'Gas Engine Type 4' and mainly covers failure modes related to 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Oil leakage', 'Lack of structure for support', 'Poor serviceability' and some 'Vibration is too high' but specifically for 'Front end housing (damper housing)' not 'Vibration isolation'. No exact match or fully applicable similar context measures for 'Vibration isolation' with the same function and failure cause are present. Therefore, no measures can be transferred and generated based on provided data without violating instruction to not create new measures beyond retrieved context."

All retrieved data relates to different failure modes (such as 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Vibration too high', 'Insufficient structural support') or different failure causes not matching the isolator mechanical damage cause. Hence, no exact or similar context match for preventive or detective measures applicable to the target failure cause."
Thermal aging or operating temperature extremes causing elastomer hardening or softening altering vibration isolation characteristics,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Thermal aging or operating temperature extremes causing elastomer hardening or softening altering vibration isolation characteristics' in the system element 'Vibration isolation' for Gas Engine Type 6 is not found in the retrieved context data. The retrieved data contains failure modes and causes related primarily to 'Vibration is too high' due to assembly or bolted joint design, 'Degradation of sealing over time', 'Oil leakage over time', and related issues in Gas Engine Type 4, but none pertain explicitly or similarly to elastomer thermal aging effects on vibration isolation stiffness.

The system element 'Vibration isolation' and the failure cause 'Material fatigue/degradation of isolator elements' is distinct compared to retrieved contexts, which mostly relate to structural or sealing interfaces and bolted joint design. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be reasonably transferred or derived from the retrieved data for this exact failure cause."

Existing retrieved context relates predominantly to different failure causes, failure modes (e.g., Oil/Mixture leakage, Incorrect positioning of sensors/locking pin, Lack of structure for support, Vibration is too high) and different system elements, mostly for Gas Engine Type 4 or other components. Hence, no exact or sufficiently similar match found to transfer measures."
"Operational factors like transient engine loads, start-up/shutdown vibrations, over-revving","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because retrieved data contains no explicitly matching failure cause or failure mode related to 'Vibration isolation' preventing loosening of bolted joints due to transient vibrations, over-revving, or operational vibration factors in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. Existing data mainly addresses different failure modes such as 'System pressure exceeding limits', 'Insufficient air/gas mixture', 'Local vibration exceeds sensor specification', and other vibration-related failures in 'Gas Engine Type 4' but focused on different system elements and functions without direct reference to bolted joint loosening through vibration isolation. Thus, no applicable measures from retrieved data to transfer or reuse."
"Environmental influences including exposure to high temperature, oil contamination, aging due to UV or chemicals","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there are no retrieved failure causes or matching failure modes related to 'Vibration isolation' or failure cause 'Environmental influences including exposure to high temperature, oil contamination, aging due to UV or chemicals' for the given target system element in the subsystem 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. All retrieved data pertains to oil system failures, sealing and leakage issues, oil contamination, oil amount on liners, bolted joint sealing, and related topics in 'Gas Engine Type 4', none of which match the vibration isolation element or its failure causes. Hence, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred or created."
"Maintenance neglect such as lack of inspection, failure to replace worn vibration isolators","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with reasoning: The target failure cause is 'Maintenance neglect such as lack of inspection, failure to replace worn vibration isolators' related to 'Vibration isolation' system element in the Gas Engine Type 6, Engine Block subsystem. The retrieved context data contains no exact or close matches for this failure cause or system element in the same or a sufficiently similar context. The retrieved failure causes all refer to design, assembly, vibration magnitude, or maintenance related to oil, sensors, seals, bolted joints, or structural design but do not address maintenance neglect of vibration isolators in bolted joints or failure prevention by replacing worn isolators. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred based on the provided data, resulting in no measures being proposed."
"Degradation or failure of vibration isolator material or components due to fatigue, material aging, or improper material selection","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Degradation or failure of vibration isolator material or components due to fatigue, material aging, or improper material selection' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element controlling vibration in the Gas Engine Type 6 does not have an exact or similar match in the retrieved context data. The retrieved failure data relates to vibration effects caused by design, assembly, or bolted joints in Gas Engine Type 4 or related subsystems, but not specifically to degradation or failure of vibration isolator material or components. There is no directly transferable preventive or detective measure for this exact failure cause and system element. Hence, no measures can be generated based on the given data."
Incorrect design tolerances or assembly leading to pre-load errors or misalignment of vibration isolator components,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Incorrect design tolerances or assembly leading to pre-load errors or misalignment of vibration isolator components' for the 'Vibration isolation' element in Gas Engine Type 6 matches in system element context, subsystem (Engine Block), and failure mode category (functional limitation of vibration isolation similar to 'Vibration is too high') with retrieved data from Gas Engine Type 4 'Engine Block' subsystem and related vibration failure modes involving design/assembly and tolerance issues. Although the exact failure cause wording differs, the core issues of design tolerances, assembly/pre-load errors, and misalignment correspond closely to the retrieved causes 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' and 'Geometry tolerances / wrong tolerance specification' that affect vibration control performance. Thus, preventive and detective measures from these causes and the related failure mode 'Vibration is too high' are applicable and sensible for transfer, respecting FMEA standards."
"Transient engine operation conditions (start-up, cool-down) causing dynamic changes in vibration isolation stiffness or damping characteristics","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target is 'Gas Engine Type 6', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Vibration isolation', failure mode 'Functional fluctuation of vibration isolation performance', and failure cause 'Transient engine operation conditions (start-up, cool-down)'. The retrieved context data contains measures related to a highly similar failure cause 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' causing 'Vibration is too high' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem for Gas Engine Type 4. Although the exact system element (Vibration isolation) and exact failure mode differ slightly, the failure cause and subsystem context match very closely, and the failure mode is vibration related. Because of strong technical relevance within the same product category and subsystem, the preventive and detective measures for that failure cause and failure mode are transferable and applicable to the target context without creating new measures."
"Improper selection or degradation of damping medium causing stiffness increase beyond design, restricting engine block movement","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode is 'Overfunctioning of vibration isolation (excessive damping)' caused by 'Improper selection or degradation of damping medium causing stiffness increase beyond design' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of 'Gas Engine Type 6'. There is no exact match or similar failure cause/failure mode combination in the retrieved context (which mostly covers failure modes related to 'Vibration is too high', 'Oil leakage', 'Insufficient structural support' etc. in Gas Engine Type 4). The retrieved data do not include failure causes or measures related specifically to degradation or improper selection of damping medium or excessive damping in vibration isolation. Hence, no applicable preventive or detective measures can be transferred."
"Incorrect vibration isolation natural frequency due to design or assembly errors, leading to resonance with engine operating frequencies","SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target failure cause 'Incorrect vibration isolation natural frequency due to design or assembly errors' causing 'Unintended vibration amplification (resonance amplification)' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' is closely related in terms of system element (vibration isolation relates to vibration control), function (control vibration frequency and amplitude), failure mode ('Vibration is too high' / unintended vibration amplification) and failure cause (design and assembly issues leading to vibration problems) to retrieved data from 'Gas Engine Type 4' in 'Engine Block' subsystem with failure mode 'Vibration is too high' and failure cause 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' or design related causes impacting vibration. Although exact system element and failure cause wording differs, the vibration isolation natural frequency issue corresponds to design and assembly issues causing vibration amplification. Therefore, preventive and detective measures related to assembly and design process for vibration induced failures are applicable and technically valid to transfer for this target context."
Mechanical jamming or contamination of vibration isolator mechanism or hydraulic elements (if active isolation),"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure cause 'Mechanical jamming or contamination of vibration isolator mechanism or hydraulic elements (if active isolation)' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6' gas engine is not present in the retrieved context data, which instead relates to different failure causes such as design issues, assembly process, bolted joint design, oil leakage, contamination, and vibration excess in elements like 'Front end housing', 'CCV system', 'V-room insulation', and 'Crankcase' in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. Furthermore, the failure cause involves mechanical jamming or contamination of isolator or hydraulic elements, which is unique and not addressed in available context. Therefore, no preventive or detective measures can be generated from the given retrieved context."
Misorientation or improper installation of vibration isolator elements,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because there is no retrieved context data explicitly matching 'Vibration isolation' system element with the failure cause 'Misorientation or improper installation of vibration isolator elements' and failure mode 'Incorrect vibration isolation directionality' in Gas Engine Type 6 engine block subsystem. All retrieved data concern other system elements (e.g., front end housing damper housing, CCV system, rear end cover, V-room insulation) and failure causes mainly related to vibration amplitude or general assembly/design issues, not specifically about misorientation or improper installation of vibration isolator elements controlling vibration isolation directionality. Thus, no exact or similarly applicable context is available."
Damper material fatigue or degradation due to mechanical stress or environmental exposure,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure cause is 'Damper material fatigue or degradation due to mechanical stress or environmental exposure' related to 'Vibration isolation' system element in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data includes failure modes and causes for vibration-related issues and leakage in 'Gas Engine Type 4' focusing on components such as front end housing, bolted joints, crankcase, seals, and blow-by system but does not include any data on damper material fatigue or degradation in vibration isolation elements or vibration dampers. No exact or sufficiently similar context with the same system element and failure cause is found to transfer measures. Hence, no preventive or detective measures can be generated without introducing unprovided data."
Improper assembly alignment causing partial decoupling of vibration damper interface,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation', function related to vibration damping interface. The failure mode 'Functional limitation - Reduced damping efficiency' due to 'Improper assembly alignment causing partial decoupling' is conceptually very close to 'Assembly process / Design for assembly' failure cause in failure mode 'Vibration is too high' or 'Insufficient structural support' in retrieved context for Gas Engine Type 4 engine block components related to vibration damping and mounting. Although exact failure cause text does not exist in retrieved data, the assembly alignment issue corresponds closely to assembly process / design for assembly causes in similar system elements and failure modes. Hence, applicable preventive and detective measures can be transferred from that context with due technical relevance."
Bolted joint loosening due to insufficient preload or vibration-induced loosening,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT: The target failure mode and cause are 'Functional interruption - Damper detachment or failure' caused by 'Bolted joint loosening due to insufficient preload or vibration-induced loosening' in the 'Vibration isolation' system element of the 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data involves failure modes and causes primarily related to sealing failures, oil leakage, structural support, and bolted joint issues in Gas Engine Type 4 but focused on different system elements (e.g., V-room insulation, crankcase, rear end cover). There is no exact nor sufficiently similar context combining vibration isolation bolted joint loosening for functional interruption in the engine block of a gas engine. Measures provided relate to bolted joint design generally but mostly in sealing or structural support contexts, not specifically vibration isolation or damper detachment. Since preventive measures must address the failure cause specifically, and detective measures must address the failure mode and cause combination exactly or in very similar context, the lack of matching or similar failure cause/mode in vibration isolation means no applicable measures can be transferred from retrieved data."
Thermal expansion mismatch or transient loading conditions during engine startup/shutdown affecting damper stiffness,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT - The target failure cause 'Thermal expansion mismatch or transient loading conditions during engine startup/shutdown affecting damper stiffness' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact match in retrieved data. However, there is a similar context for 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' as a failure cause associated with vibration-related failure modes in components related to the engine block (e.g., damper housing and other engine block parts) in 'Gas Engine Type 4'. The failure mode in the retrieved context is 'Vibration is too high' and relates to fluctuating vibration behavior caused by transient loads and thermal effects, which is analogous to the given target failure cause. Thus, preventive and detective measures for 'Transient engine operation (start up, cool down)' in vibration-related failure modes in the engine block from a very similar product category and subsystem element are applicable, provided naming variances are considered."
Incorrect material selection or damper design leading to overly rigid interface,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode is 'Overfunction - Excessive stiffness in vibration isolator' due to 'Incorrect material selection or damper design leading to overly rigid interface' in the 'Vibration isolation' element of 'Engine Block' subsystem in 'Gas Engine Type 6'. The retrieved data pertains to different failure modes such as 'Vibration is too high', 'Insufficient structural support', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Degradation of sealing over time', etc., mostly in 'Gas Engine Type 4', system elements primarily 'Front end housing', 'Rear end cover', 'V-room insulation', and other components. None directly address overfunction or excessive stiffness caused by material or damper design in vibration isolators specifically. Therefore, no applicable preventive or detective measures from retrieved data exist for this exact failure cause and mode under target system context."
Resonance due to improper damper geometry or manufacturing variances,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system (Gas Engine Type 6) and subsystem (Engine Block) match the retrieved data (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block) on System Element (vibration isolation ≈ damper housing/front end housing vibration isolation function), Function (interface vibration dampers with mounting points to minimize noise transmission approximates vibration control), Failure Mode (unintended vibration transmission related to resonance, in retrieved data represented as 'Vibration is too high' or related vibration failure modes), and Failure Cause (resonance due to geometry or manufacturing variance corresponds to geometry tolerances/wrong tolerance specification and design-related causes). Although exact system element naming differs, vibration isolation and damper housing share the vibration mitigation function, so preventive and detective measures from 'Vibration is too high' related causes especially geometry tolerances and design are applicable. Measures related specifically to bolt design, assembly process, and geometry tolerances from the retrieved context will be transferred and adapted while ensuring relevance to vibration isolator resonance issues. Measures that target failure causes unrelated to resonance or vibration transmissibility (e.g., oil leakage, poor serviceability) are excluded."
"Contamination ingress, material degradation, or mechanical seizure within damper element","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target failure mode 'Sticking at a certain value - Damper stiffness locked due to internal mechanical failure or contamination' in 'Vibration isolation' of 'Engine Block' on 'Gas Engine Type 6' has no exact match in the retrieved context data. The available data mostly pertains to related but different failure modes such as 'Vibration is too high', 'Oil contamination', 'Oil leakage', 'Degradation of sealing over time', and 'Insufficient structural support' in similar subsystems and similar product category (Gas Engine Type 4). However, no failures or causes are recorded for 'sticking' or 'damper element mechanical seizure or contamination'. These failure causes, such as contamination ingress and internal mechanical seizure in a vibration damper element, are not addressed by any preventive or detective measures in the provided data. Applying unrelated failure modes/measures would violate the instructions to use only retrieved data applicable to the exact or similar failure cause, mode, element, and context. Therefore, no measures can be provided."
Incorrect installation orientation or design flaw causing vibration isolator to behave as coupling element,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the target failure mode 'Incorrect direction' of the 'Vibration isolation' system element in 'Gas Engine Type 6' with the specific failure cause 'Incorrect installation orientation or design flaw causing vibration isolator to behave as coupling element' has no exact or similar matches in the retrieved context data. The retrieved data mostly relates to failure modes like 'Vibration is too high', 'Oil/Mixture leakage over time', 'Incorrect positioning of sensors/locking pin' or 'Insufficient structural support' in Gas Engine Type 4, which do not specifically address installation orientation or design flaws causing vibration isolator behavior as a mechanical coupling path."
Assembly process / Design for assembly issues; Bolted joint design deficiencies; Crankcase design mismatches; Geometry tolerances deviations; Transient engine operation effects,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation' for the function of interfacing vibration dampers with mounting points to minimize noise transmission. The failure mode 'Vibration is too high' and the failure causes (Assembly process / Design for assembly issues; Bolted joint design deficiencies; Crankcase design mismatches; Geometry tolerances deviations; Transient engine operation effects) are similar to those in the retrieved data for 'Gas Engine Type 4' subsystem 'Engine Block' component 'Front end housing (damper housing)' with the failure mode 'Vibration is too high'. Though the system element identity is not exactly the same name, the functional similarity and failure context are close enough to apply these measures. The measures identified in the retrieved data cover the failure causes listed and are applicable in the target context. Therefore, preventive and detective measures are transferred and adapted accordingly without creating new measures."
Assembly process / Design for assembly issues; Bolted joint design deficiencies; Crankcase design faults; Front/End cover design deficiencies; Geometry tolerances deviations; Pipe design factors,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT: The target system is 'Gas Engine Type 6' with subsystem 'Engine Block' and system element 'Vibration isolation' focusing on 'Interface vibration dampers with mounting points to minimize noise transmission', with failure mode 'Insufficient structural support' and multiple related failure causes. The retrieved data shows closely related failure modes like 'Insufficient structural support' and 'Lack of structure for support' in 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' involving similar causes such as 'Assembly process / Design for assembly', 'Bolted joint design deficiencies', 'Crankcase design faults', 'Front/End cover design deficiencies', 'Geometry tolerances deviations', and 'Pipe design factors'. Both contexts share system category, subsystem, failure modes, and related causes for structural support and bolted joint design issues. Therefore, applicable preventive and detective measures can be transferred and adapted to the target context without creating new measures, ensuring technical relevance."
"Vibration induced preload loss, inadequate bolted joint design or assembly","DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the retrieved context only includes failure modes and failure causes related to 'Oil/Mixture leakage', 'Vibration is too high', and sealing related issues in Gas Engine Type 4 and components like crankcase, V-room insulation, front end housing, rear end cover, etc. No retrieved data exists for the exact failure mode 'Bolt loosening from vibration' for the system element 'Vibration isolation' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of Gas Engine Type 6. Thus, per the decision matrix, no measures can be generated for this exact combination from the retrieved data."
