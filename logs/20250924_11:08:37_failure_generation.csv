Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact matches or retrieved data directly relate specifically to the CCV (blow-by) system function 'Maintain a certain oil concentration limit during the blow-by separation' in the Gas Engine Type 4 context. Although multiple retrieved failure modes and causes are from the CCV (blow-by) system or related Engine Block components, their functions mostly relate to 'Directs oil back to the crankcase', 'Distributes blow-by gas to filter system', or 'Oil leakage'. None explicitly address maintaining oil concentration limits during blow-by gas separation. Hence, a creative, technical brainstorming approach is necessary while leveraging similarities in failure mechanisms of sealing, oil management, flow control, and filtering in blow-by systems. This approach integrates design, development, testing, and after-sales perspectives to generate failure modes, effects, and causes specifically for the target function and element."

The provided retrieved data comprehensively covers failure modes, effects, and causes relevant to the function and system element without requiring extrapolation or creative generation of new modes. Therefore, only the failure modes, effects, and causes found in the retrieved context data are used in the output, strictly maintaining FMEA standards and technical accuracy."
Sealing of main oil gallery,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Piston cooling jet (PCJ) element, function 'Sealing of main oil gallery') exactly matches the retrieved data context. Failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes are derived directly from the specifically relevant data for the PCJ with function sealing of the main oil gallery in the Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem, ensuring full technical accuracy and strict adherence to FMEA standards without introducing unvalidated failure modes or causes."

The retrieved failure modes, causes, and effects specifically correspond to the cylinder liner assembly sealing coolant jacket function, thus no new failure data generation is needed or allowed per exact match criteria."
Containment of combustion gases,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context exactly matches the retrieved data by Product ('Gas Engine Type 4'), Subsystem ('Engine Block'), System Element ('Cylinder liner assembly'), and Function ('Containment of combustion gases'). The failure modes, failure effects and failure causes documented in the retrieved data are specific and technically detailed for the same context. Therefore, only the failure modes, effects and causes found in the retrieved data are used as per EXACT_MATCH guidelines."

The retrieved context contains detailed, technically accurate failure modes, failure effects and failure causes specifically for the Cylinder liner assembly sealing function in the targeted product and subsystem. No deviation or contextual adaptation is needed, and all required FMEA data is present in the retrieved data."
Provide load path from CH to crankcase,"EXACT_MATCH as the target product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Cylinder liner assembly), and function (Provide load path from CH to crankcase) exactly match the retrieved data. The retrieved data provides multiple technically valid failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes specifically for this same context.

Guidance for power unit,"EXACT_MATCH based on the provided data: The target system context matches precisely with retrieved data where the product is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem is 'Engine Block', system element is 'Cylinder liner assembly', and function is 'Guidance for power unit'. Therefore, failure modes, failure causes, and failure effects are directly adopted from the retrieved data without extrapolation or generation of new failure types."

The failure mode 'Excessive liner deformation' and its related causes and effects are directly applicable without the need to generate new failure modes or causes as per the EXACT_MATCH criteria."
Direct oil to cylinder liner assembly,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system context is a Gas Engine Type 4, Subsystem Engine Block, System Element Crankcase, with the function to Direct oil to cylinder liner assembly. Retrieved data related to this exact element-function combination is not present (no EXACT MATCH). However, multiple retrieved failure data are available from the same product category (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), mostly involving the Crankcase element and related functions involving oil directing and sealing oil. This fits the SIMILAR_CONTEXT criteria to some extent; however, the exact function 'Direct oil to cylinder liner assembly' on the Crankcase itself is directly addressed in few documents but the majority covers related sub-elements (e.g. Cylinder liner assembly) or sealing functions. Given some slight variation in subsystem contextual function focus, the best fit is SIMILAR_CONTEXT. Therefore, leveraging SIMILAR_CONTEXT with analytical adaptation is appropriate. Using the detailed known failure modes and causes on crankcase and oil directing functions, failure modes specifically related to the crankcase directing oil function can be generated with adaptations to fill in gaps relevant to oil directing to the liner assembly, ensuring the failure modes adequately cover flow issues, oil quantity issues, sealing and integrity of flow paths within the crankcase as an oil routing element. This approach maintains technical accuracy and FMEA standards by directly referencing retrieved failure modes and causes and adapting them with logical extensions to the exact function of interest."
Direct oil to lubrication system,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with reasoning: The target system is a Crankcase in the Engine Block subsystem of a Gas Engine Type 4, with the distinct function 'Direct oil to lubrication system'. The retrieved data does not contain explicit failure modes directly labeled for the 'Direct oil to lubrication system' function of the Crankcase, although there are related data for 'Sealing against leakages oil' in the Crankcase and some failure modes relating to oil flow and cleanliness regarding the Crankcase and associated components. This implies partial but not exact context for the function. Recognizing Crankcase as a system element responsible for oil routing, the retrieved data mostly focus on sealing and oil leakage failure modes or oil supply issues in different components closely linked but not exactly matching the target function. According to the decision matrix, this constitutes a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because the exact function and system element combination ('Crankcase' with 'Direct oil to lubrication system' function) has no exact match in retrieved data. Therefore, a creative and technically accurate generation of failure modes, failure effects, and causes will be performed while leveraging relevant retrieved patterns and internal engineering knowledge for this element/function in this product category."
Direct Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element is the 'Crankcase' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the specific function 'Direct Oil-Gas Mixture to CCV (blow-by) system'. The retrieved data predominantly references failure modes, causes, and effects related to the 'CCV (blow-by) system' component's functions or the broader crankcase sealing and oil handling functions but does not directly address the crankcase's function of directing the oil-gas mixture specifically to the CCV system. While highly related, the exact function-context combination (Crankcase directing blow-by mixture to CCV system) is not explicitly present in the retrieved data. Therefore, by FMEA context analysis, this is a DIFFERENT_CONTEXT scenario requiring creative technical knowledge and multi-perspective brainstorming to generate failure modes, effects, and causes precisely tailored to the crankcase’s function in this role. We adapt patterns from similar but not identical system elements and functions, ensuring coverage of all plausible failure types and correct technical terminology for high FMEA quality."
Provide contact interface to cylinder head assembly,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4' product, 'Engine Block' subsystem, 'Crankcase' system element, and the function 'Provide contact interface to cylinder head assembly'. Retrieved data includes direct failure modes, failure effects, and causes explicitly matching the Crankcase and its interface/contact functions with the cylinder head assembly within the same product, subsystem, and component context. Hence, only failure modes, effects, and causes from this exact context are used without extrapolation or generation of new failures."
Direct Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context exactly matches retrieved data in terms of Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), and Function (Direct Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head assembly). Retrieved failure modes, effects, and causes directly relate to the Crankcase directing air/gas/mixture to the cylinder head assembly in the gas engine. Therefore, only the failure data from the retrieved context are used without adding new failure modes, causes or effects beyond the supplied data."
Provide contact interface to CCV (blow-by) system,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data directly relates to the Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase element, and specifically addresses the function 'Provide contact interface to CCV (blow-by) system' with relevant failure modes, effects and causes. The data includes detailed failure modes such as lack of sealing, system pressure exceeding limits leading to leakage within the crankcase interface, with associated effects and failure causes strictly aligned with the exact system context."
Provide contact interface and structural support to V-room isolation,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', with the function to provide contact interface and structural support to V-room isolation. The retrieved context has precise matching data for the 'Crankcase' related to the 'Engine Block' of 'Gas Engine Type 4', specifically including failure modes affecting the Crankcase's function in relation to V-room isolation support. Therefore, the failure modes, effects, and causes can be directly adopted from the retrieved data without extrapolation or new generation. The retrieved failure modes are technically relevant and consistent with standard FMEA practice for this system element and function."
Seal against coolant leakages,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact matches were found in retrieved data for the failure mode specifically of the 'Crankcase' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' with the function 'Seal against coolant leakages'. Existing failure data primarily relate to sealing of oil leakage, crankcase sealing against blow-by gases, or sealing of crankshaft but not specifically seal against coolant leakages from the crankcase. Although the product category and subsystem are the same, failure mode-function-element exact data for coolant sealing at crankcase is absent. Therefore, a generative approach is applied using engineering perspectives and existing patterns of sealing-related failures to generate plausible failure modes, effects, and causes strictly applicable to CG leakage sealing function of crankcase. This approach ensures technical correctness and FMEA standards adherence."
Provide structural support for internal engine components,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact or similar context data exists for the 'Crankcase' system element with the explicit function 'Provide structural support for internal engine components' in the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. The retrieved data references failure modes related to sealing, gas mixture routing, and serviceability associated with the crankcase, but not directly its primary structural support function. Therefore, primary failure modes relevant to the structural role must be generated using multi-perspective brainstorming and engineering knowledge specific to crankcase structural support in gas engines, while leveraging some analogous data hints on design and material causes. This ensures comprehensive and technically accurate coverage relevant to the requested function."
Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data perfectly matches the target system context with identical Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Crankcase), and Function (Provide gas mixture route to cylinder head). Therefore, only failure modes, effects, and causes explicitly found in the retrieved data relevant to this function and component are used. No new failure modes or causes outside retrieved data are introduced to maintain consistency and technical accuracy in line with the EXACT_MATCH criteria."
Seal against oil leakages,"EXACT_MATCH based on retrieved data showing failure modes, failure causes, and failure effects directly linked to the 'Crankcase' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of the 'Gas Engine Type 4' system. The function 'Seal against oil leakages' matches the related failure mode descriptions of 'Oil leakage', 'Oil leakage over time', 'Degradation of sealing over time', 'Oil leakage through interface over time', and 'Lack of sealing'. The retrieved data comprehensively covers relevant failure modes, effects and causes for the crankcase sealing function with technical accuracy consistent with FMEA standards. No new failure modes or causes should be invented beyond this explicit context."
Transmit energy between crankcase and CCV (blow-by) system,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: There is no direct retrieved failure mode data explicitly describing failures and causes for the function 'Transmit energy between crankcase and CCV (blow-by) system' of the 'Crankcase' element itself (only indirect related failure modes related to CCV system or crankcase leakage, flow hindrance, vibration, sealing, etc.). The retrieved data predominantly address failure modes of the CCV (blow-by) system or interfaces but not specifically the crankcase transmitting energy to CCV function as a core function. Given the unique functional identity and absence of exact or closely matching failure modes, a full multi-perspective brainstorming approach has been applied, leveraging engineering knowledge of crankcase and CCV interface functions to generate technical failure modes, effects, and causes tailored to 'Crankcase' element ensuring technical accuracy according to FMEA standards."
Allow venting locations for coolant circuit,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data perfectly matches the target product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (Crankcase), and the specific function ('Allow venting locations for coolant circuit'). The failure modes, causes and effects are derived from validated technical sources specifically referring to this context, requiring no additional generation or assumptions."
Ensure absence of air in coolant circuit,"EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data explicitly covers the 'Crankcase' component in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of the 'Gas Engine Type 4' product for the function 'Ensure absence of air in coolant circuit'. The failure mode 'Air in the coolant circuit system' is directly documented, along with its causes and effects. Therefore, only the retrieved context data is used, meeting EXACT_MATCH criteria. No external generation of failure modes, causes or effects beyond what is found in the data is necessary or allowed."
Provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner,"EXACT_MATCH: The target system context (Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, Crankcase, function to provide coolant flow route to cylinder liner) exactly matches multiple retrieved data entries. The failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes are explicitly documented for this exact combination, meeting strict FMEA standards and technical accuracy. Hence, no new failure modes, effects, or causes are generated beyond those in the retrieved context data."
Seal against gas mixture leakages,"EXACT_MATCH - The target system context is Gas Engine Type 4, Engine Block subsystem, and the Crankcase component, with the function 'Seal against gas mixture leakages'. Retrieved data includes multiple failure modes specifically associated with 'Seals the crankcase' or similar sealing functions in the Gas Engine Type 4's Engine Block subsystem and closely related components such as Rear end cover, Front end housing, and Crankcase itself. Failure modes such as 'Oil leakage', 'Blow-by leakage (or the other way around)', 'Lack of sealing', and 'Degradation of sealing over time' are directly documented with their causes, effects, and detection/prevention measures. This exact match in product category, subsystem, system element, and function justifies using the retrieved failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes exclusively, without generating new or unrelated data."
Provide contact and fit to PCJ (Power Cylinder Joint),"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: No exact match data exists for the 'Crankcase' component with the specific function 'Provide contact and fit to PCJ (Power Cylinder Joint)' in the retrieved context. The nearest context data involves related functions such as sealing, alignment, and contact issues around the crankcase and PCJ or surrounding components but not the exact function of 'contact and fit to PCJ'. Therefore, a creative generative approach leveraging retrieved related failure data of crankcase and PCJ interface is applied, adapted with technical accuracy and FMEA standard terminology."
Provide installation space for sensors,"SIMILAR_CONTEXT because the target system is 'Gas Engine Type 4', subsystem 'Engine Block', system element 'Crankcase', and function 'Provide installation space for sensors'. Although no direct data for the 'Crankcase' component with this specific function was found in the retrieved context, there are multiple retrieved failure modes for very closely related components within the same subsystem (e.g., Front end housing (damper housing)) in the same product, with the identical or very similar function 'Provides installation space for sensors'. Given the identical product category, subsystem, and function, and the system element being closely related functional housing elements (Crankcase and Front end housing), the failure modes, effects, and causes from the retrieved context can be analytically adapted for the Crankcase element in the 'Engine Block' of Gas Engine Type 4. Similar vibration, design, assembly, and geometrical tolerance related issues apply, especially given the housing function to provide sensor installation space. Additional brainstorming was done to confirm relevance and add any necessary failure modes aligned with crankcase-specific characteristics while adhering to FMEA standards and technical accuracy."
Provide installation space for cable routing,"EXACT_MATCH because the target system context matches exactly with the retrieved data: Product 'Gas Engine Type 4', Subsystem 'Engine Block', System Element 'Crankcase', and Function 'Provides installation space for cable routing'.

Therefore, only failure data explicitly found within this exact context are used for FMEA failure mode, effect, and cause generation without generating any new or adapted entries."
Provides structural support,"EXACT_MATCH based on fully matching Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Front end housing (damper housing)), and Function (Provides structural support).

Therefore, only retrieved context data is used without inventing new failure scenarios."

Failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes are directly available from retrieved data for this exact context, so no new failure modes, effects, or causes outside this data are generated."
Provides installation space for maintenance cover,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT because no failure mode, cause, or effect data specifically matches the target system element 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' providing the function 'Provides installation space for maintenance cover' in the Gas Engine Type 4 engine block subsystem. Retrieved data is either absent or relates to different system elements/functions such as CCV system, front end housing, or the sealing function of the rear end cover. Hence, multi-perspective brainstorming is applied with technical expertise to generate valid technical failure modes, effects and causes for the target element and its specified function."
Provides maintenance space for removing camshaft,"DIFFERENT_CONTEXT with detailed reasoning: The target system element 'Rear end cover (flywheel side)' in the 'Engine Block' subsystem of 'Gas Engine Type 4' serves a unique mechanical and maintenance function (providing maintenance space for camshaft removal) distinct from all retrieved data, which mostly covers 'Crankcase' or 'CCV (blow-by) system' elements and their sealing, vibration, and serviceability related failure modes. There is no direct exact or similar function-element match in the retrieved data, and the rear end cover has different mechanical interaction, structural roles, and maintenance aspects compared to crankcase or blow-by system components. Hence, this is a fundamentally different context requiring creative, technically accurate failure mode generation considering mechanical design, assembly, maintenance access, and structural integrity viewpoints."
"Provides structural support (e.g. starter motos, oil pan)","EXACT_MATCH: The retrieved data exactly matches the target system context in terms of Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (Rear end cover (flywheel side)), and the Function (Provides structural support (e.g. starter motos, oil pan)).

Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase,"EXACT_MATCH because the retrieved data perfectly matches the target system context in product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), and function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture through the crankcase). The failure modes, effects, and causes are directly found in the retrieved data and must be used exclusively without generating new failure modes or causes outside this context to maintain technical accuracy and relevance."
Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head,"EXACT_MATCH because the target product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), and function (Allows Air/Gas/Mixture to cylinder head) exactly match the retrieved data from the RAG and vector databases. The retrieved data contains highly specific and relevant failure modes, failure effects, and failure causes corresponding to this exact context."
Sealing to lower crankcase,"EXACT_MATCH because the target product (Gas Engine Type 4), subsystem (Engine Block), system element (V-room insulation), and function (Sealing to lower crankcase) exactly match the retrieved data context. The retrieved data provides specific failure modes, effects, and causes directly related to the V-room insulation sealing function in the lower crankcase of this exact engine type. Therefore, only retrieved context failure modes, effects, and causes are used without any additions or adaptations."
Sealing to upper crankcase,"EXACT_MATCH based on fully matching Product (Gas Engine Type 4), Subsystem (Engine Block), System Element (V-room insulation) and Function (Sealing to upper crankcase). The retrieved data contains multiple failure modes, failure effects and failure causes exactly for the V-room insulation sealing function in the engine block of Gas Engine Type 4, compliant with FMEA standards and technical accuracy, allowing direct use of these data without any generation of new failure modes."
